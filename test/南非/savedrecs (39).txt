DE LEGO Mindstroms NXT; Control Systems
AB This paper introduces a low-cost LEGO Mindstroms NXT motor system (for short, LEGO motor system) [6] for teaching classical and modern control theories in standard third-year undergraduate courses. The LEGO motor system in conjuction with Matlab, Simulink and several necessary toolboxes [8] can be used to demonstrate: (1) a modelling technique; (2) PID (proportional-integral-differential) control; (3) state feedback control and estimator design. This paper describes the use of these demonstrations during three lab sessions, and illustrates their usefulness for helping students to understand the modelling and control systems theories.

AB The most accuracy solid state gyroscopes are the gyro based on Sagnac principal of light. Unfortunately, the gyro can not be miniaturized due to the needs of long light-path to increase the phase difference. The problem of this obstacle is that the speed of light is too fast and the phase change due to the light speed is too small to be detected. It is strongly needs a solution to increase the phase change by decreasing the light speed! For that purpose, the atomic wave gyro had been proposed based on the freeze atom technology, which will reduce the speed of light according to the quantum mechanics principle, it does works but the extra large equipment will be needed, and no way to make the atom wave gyro in MEMS scale. This paper is formulating a waveguide gyro based on the author's previous work. From the theoretical formulation, the wave guide gyro is 1000 times accuracy and sensitive than Sagnac gyro at the situation of having same length of waveguide.

AB The Good Urban Governance theme is closely viewed as associated with concepts like service delivery, citizen's satisfaction, access to basic quality services, managing and delivery of infrastructure services to citizens. Urban governance deals with complex issues demanding interventions at various levels for issues like urbanization and growth, management of local economy, increasing infrastructure and service delivery pressure on cities, etc. Under these complex circumstances, the municipalities or urban agencies find it extremely difficult / challenging to cope with efficient delivery and management of essential basic and infrastructure services to its citizens. Such issues have largely impacted municipalities in performing their services efficiently and are trapped under a vicious cycle of low service delivery performance, thereby leading to low revenue generation for achieving sustainable governance. However, municipalities have taken a number of initiatives by introducing the implementation of e-Governance programmes or application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for managing effective governance. Often, such initiatives are seen working at isolated levels without any integration with other applications.
   The traditional application of a Geographic Information System (GIS) focused on select areas at local level like mapping, utility management, urban planning, etc. The real potential of GIS has seldom been used in most of the decision making processes. The GIS applications are largely seen in selected departments within a municipal or urban management entities dealing with services to citizens. The potential of GIS as a decision making process or achieving sustainable good urban governance across cross-cutting areas at municipal level is still been largely untapped. The municipal applications of GIS across various countries showcases the potential of GIS in municipal management like in the areas of property management, traffic and transportation, urban planning, solid waste management, slum improvement, urban design and renewal, financial resource mobilization etc. The initiatives are largely introduced for implementing specific project needs to address limited issues. Often the areas of overall governance whether its strategic planning, integration, governance, management and delivery of services have not been fully achieved under such an isolated approach.
   This paper is setout to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches of achieving good urban governance at municipal levels. Based on the selected isolated / integrated approach of existing applications of GIS at municipal level, the paper discusses key issues and success parameters for local governance. The key strengths of selected case studies from various parts of the world provide a basis for an approach of GIS for achieving a sustainable governance system. The paper concludes in the conceptualization of achieving a sustainable good urban governance system through an approach of GIS across cross-cutting municipal themes.

AB A schedule-based approach, such as TDMA, is more efficient than a Contention-based approach in terms of energy saving by switching sensors into sleeping mode. However it does not use the transmission media effectively as each timeslot is dedicated to a sensor and therefore cannot be used by others should it be idle. Moreover a schedule-based approach requires a central node to manage and broadcast the schedule to other members, causing high delay and unscalability. On the other hand, contention-based protocols can be used in a distributed fashion. But contention-based protocols such as IEEE802.11 wastes a lot of energy in idle listening. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach between contention and schedule based protocols. The preliminary results show that our proposed approach uses transmission media more efficiently leading to lower delay while preserving energy for WSNs.

AB A control and observation centre for rocket triggered lightning research has been constructed. A risk analysis performed using lEC 62305- 2 shows that the risk of loss of life within the structure under normal conditions is well below the tolerable risk level. By adjusting the equations defined in the risk standard risks associated with individual events can be calculated. The implication of these on personal risk is still uncertain. By using methods highlighted in the standards a visual understanding of personal risk can be obtained. The implication of this is that an external lightning protection system is required. The safety of personal and equipment at the control and observation centre is critical. This paper discusses the design of the lightning protection system design and installed for the control and observation centre.

AB This research aims to investigate the effect of adding a quasi-hemispherical object at the top of a Franklin rod. This will significantly reduce corona and hence the space charge under the high electric fields experienced during the descent of the downward moving leader. By obtaining the appropriate size and shape of the object at the top of the termination the aim is to send a single streamer at precisely the correct moment for it to undergo streamer to leader transition and intercept the downward moving leader. Research as well as preliminary simulation and experimentation point to a radius of approximately 0.3 - 0.35 m. A test setup with a 5 m air gap has been designed and manufactured with the aim of producing upward leaders from competing air terminations, thus simulating natural lightning conditions more closely. The experimental setup is an inverted rod plane gap and includes all the necessary d.c. biasing circuitry and measuring equipment. Eleven air terminations were tested against the Franklin rod and the results captured with a high speed gated camera. A 1.2/50 mu s lightning impulse waveform was used during testing.

AB Observations of Iightning strikes to Brixton Tower in South Africa are investigated in this paper. The tower is topographically situated in an ideal location to study Iightning strikes, and has the benefit of a physical height of 250 m. Observations presented in this paper were made through photographic recordings of lightning events from November 2009 to May 2010. Lightning data from the Southern African Lightning Detection Network (SALDN) is used to match recorded Iightning strokes to photographed events. The SALDN provides the associated stroke parameters for assessment of the events in terms of peak current values as well as rise and decay times. Particular focus is given to studying positive polarity events. This includes an investigation into positive strikes to the tower and an event of a downward positive flash that appears to initiate an upward flash from the tower.

AB The objective of a lightning protection system (LPS) is to comprehensively protect humans, animals, structures, systems and equipment against the damaging and dangerous effects of lightning. Human behaviour during a lightning storm is an important consideration and emphasises the need for a holistic safety strategy over an extended period of time. Lightning protection solutions must be holistically engineered and relevant risks (due to lightning and in a wider context) must be assessed and managed. Furthermore, the ongoing integrity of the LPS must be properly coordinated with all relevant parties (for example at a plant) and maintained. Awareness and training of all stakeholders and potentially affected parties in respect of the objectives, measures and plans in place is key to the effectiveness and sustainability of the strategy and solution. This paper discusses the requirements and key elements of an Integrated Lightning Engineering Plan (ILEP) and argues that such a comprehensive and integrated plan should be the overarching and coordinating engineering management framework to enable an effective and holistic lightning protection strategy and solution.

AB In South Africa, lightning kills people every year. People who work outdoors are particularly vulnerable to lightning strikes. Strategies need to be developed to reduce the number of people killed or injured by lightning. Many people, however, have firm views and beliefs about lightning and any strategy to improve their safety with respect to lightning, will have to take cognisance of these beliefs. This paper looks at the strategies that engineers can follow to familiarise themselves with the lightning beliefs in rural areas in Southern Africa.

AB There is a problem of unfairness in allocation of radio resources among heterogeneous mobile terminals in heterogeneous wireless networks. Low-capability mobile terminals (such as single-mode terminals) suffer high call blocking probability whereas high-capability mobile terminals (such as quad-mode terminals) experience very low call blocking probability, in the same heterogeneous wireless network. This paper proposes a joint call admission control (JCAC) algorithm to reduce this problem of unfairness. The proposed JCAC algorithm makes call admission decisions based on mobile terminal modality (capability), network load, and radio access technology (RAT) terminal support index. The objectives of the proposed JCAC algorithm are to reduce call blocking/ dropping probability, and ensure fairness in allocation of radio resources among heterogeneous mobile terminals in heterogeneous networks. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the proposed JCAC scheme in heterogeneous wireless networks and derive expression for call blocking / dropping probability. The performance of the proposed JCAC algorithm is compared with that of other JCAC algorithm. Results show the proposed algorithm reduces call blocking/dropping probability in the networks, and ensure fairness in allocation of radio resources among heterogeneous terminals.

AB There are many patellofemoral prostheses designs available for patellofemoral resurfacing, but few studies provide results objectively comparing these designs. In this study two designs are compared on the basis of patella kinematics and patellofemoral kinetics by means of a computational technique. Results indicated that the patellae displaced laterally after trochlear engagement, while tilt patterns were irregular between volunteers. Patellofemoral contact loads increased with knee flexion, whereas medial patellofemoral tension diminished. The results from three volunteer-specific models showed that Prosthesis B would reproduce similar patella kinematics and patellofemoral kinetics to the baseline models. The computational technique provided a means by which prostheses designs could be compared with similar input and boundary values.

AB A custom, patient-specific unicompartmental knee replacement was developed using a unsupervised neural network trained on a database of healthy knee geometries. This custom implant was then compared to a conventional implant in terms of contact stress in a Finite Element Model. The custom implant experienced lower contact stresses at the tibiofemoral joint compared to the conventional implant. The custom implant stresses were further reduced with the use of a customized mobile bearing. The custom implant also displayed more uniform stress distribution at the bone-implant interface.

AB Background and aims: To establish gait analysis as part of routine clinical diagnoses, physicians demand accurate and flexible motion capture (Mocap). Currently, popular optical, mechanical and acoustic Mocap systems offer acceptable repeatability, but fall short of the spatial and economic benefits accompanying inertial motion capture (IMC). However, IMC is considered adolescent due to limited testing in gait analysis. This paper aims to address this hindrance through within-day and between test day repeatability studies. Methods: To determine the repeatability of IMC, routine gait studies were done on 30 able-bodied males. Repeatability was quantified using the coefficient of multiple determination (CMD) and the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Results: IMC-recorded kinematics were highly repeatable for within-day (CMD: 0.786-0.984 or CMC: 0.881-0.992) and between-day trials (CMD: 0.771-0.991 or CMC: 0.872-0.995). The results compare well to those from similar repeatability studies in the literature based on optical Mocap systems.

ID HEART MURMURS; CLASSIFICATION; SKILLS; SOUND
AB Developing countries have a large population of children living with undiagnosed heart murmurs. As a result of an accompanying skills shortage, most of these children will not get the necessary treatment. The objective of this paper was to develop a decision support system. This could enable health care providers in developing countries with tools to screen large amounts of children without the need for expensive equipment or specialist skills. For this purpose an algorithm was designed and tested to detect heart murmurs in digitally recorded signals. A specificity of 94% and a sensitivity of 91% were achieved using novel signal processing techniques and an ensemble of neural networks as classifier.

AB This article examines the patterns of discipline choices at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in post-apartheid South Africa. It offers a quantitative overview of student enrolments and graduations in all major disciplines classified by the Department of Education. The analysis demonstrates that the emerging big disciplines and top growers at both under- and post- graduate levels in South Africa are mostly professional disciplines. We explain this popularity of professional disciplines as a 'natural' phenomenon given the strong impulse for economic and social upliftment in post apartheid South Africa. Of concern, however is that the size or growth rate of a certain discipline does not necessary predict a high throughput rate. Another major finding emerging from the data is the numerical dominance of Human Sciences in South Africa at both levels, implying that the promotion of the study of Science and Technology in the country did not seem to have been significantly fruitful.

AB Real-time video enhancement is generally achieved using costly specialized hardware that have specific functions and outputs. Commercial off-the-shelf hardware, such as desktop computers with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), are also commonly used as cost effective solutions for real-time video processing. In the past, the limitations in computer hardware meant that real-time video enhancement was mainly done on desktop GPUs with minimal use of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). These algorithms were simple and easily parallelizable in nature, which enabled them to achieve real-time performance. However, complex enhancement algorithms also require the sequential processing of data and this cannot be easily achieved in real-time on a GPU. In this paper, the current advances in mobile CPU and CPU hardware are used to implement video enhancement algorithms in a new way on a mobile computer. Both the CPU and GPU are used effectively to achieve real. time performance for complex image enhancement algorithms that require both sequential and parallel processing operations. Results are presented for histogram equalization, local adaptive histogram equalization, contrast enhancement using tone mapping and exposure fusion of multiple 8-bit grey scale videos of size up to 1600x1200 pixels.

DE Handover delay; Handover coordinator; Packet loss
AB The next generation wireless networks will comprise interworking heterogeneous wireless access network technologies. The interworking of these networks will enable access ubiquity, hence mobility, particularly vertical handover between the networks becomes topical. Thus, coordination within this diverse environment in terms of handover management is required to improve the handover performance. Furthermore, it is recommended to maintain simplicity in the resource-poor mobile devices and yet keep them powerful for efficiently running rich real-time multimedia applications during mobility. Thus, this paper motivates that the handling of handover operations must be kept in the network infrastructure. Consequently, the vertical handover mechanism introduced in the paper exploits the advantages of network-based mobility management in heterogeneous wireless networks and proposes the incorporation of a network-based handover coordinator to improve the handover performance between the networks in terms of handover delay and packet loss. After all, mobility management protocols do not support seamless handover on their own. The handover coordinator, therefore, ensures that the vertical handover between the networks is transparent to active connections during the handover period. Simulation results show the benefits of the handover coordinator to the network-based mobility management in a heterogeneous wireless access environment in terms of reduced handover delay and packet loss.

AB In this paper, a novel method called offset modulation (OM-OFDM) is proposed, to control the peak-to-average power ratio of an OFDM signal. The theoretical bandwidth occupancy of the proposed offset modulated signal is derived. Using this bandwidth occupancy a closed form theoretical bit error rate (BER) expression for an offset modulated transmission is further derived, validated and compared to OFDM. Thereafter, the authors present a newly applied decision metric, which is used to compare the offset modulated method to the traditional OFDM transmission. After studying these results, OM-OFDM is shown to offer between 1.23 dB - 1.65 dB net performance gain at a BER of 10(-4) when compared to an OFDM transmission in frequency selective fading and additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions respectively.

ID GRAPH-CUTS
AB Graph cuts have proven useful for image segmentation and for volumetric reconstruction in multiple view stereo. However, solutions are biased: the cost function tends to favour either a short boundary (in 2D) or a boundary with a small area (in 3D). This bias can be avoided by instead minimising the cut ratio, which normalises the cost by a measure of the boundary size. This paper uses ideas from discrete differential geometry to develop a linear programming formulation for finding a minimum ratio cut in arbitrary dimension, which allows constraints on the solution to be specified in a natural manner, and which admits an efficient and globally optimal solution. Results are shown for 2D segmentation and for 3D volumetric reconstruction.

AB Recently population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm has been applied to a range of problems in engineering with promising results. However, in most of the literature the standard PBIL with fixed learning rate has been used. It has been shown that when applied to dynamic environment as the one encountered in power systems, adaptive learning rate is more appropriate to use. In this paper, Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm with adaptive learning rate is used to tune the parameters of a power system controller for damping power oscillations in a multi-machine power system. The optimization of controller's parameters has been performed over pre-specified range of system operating conditions. Robustness Evaluation of the proposed controller based on eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulation shows that the proposed controller is more robust than the conventional controller over the range of operating conditions considered.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of meta-heuristics as low-level heuristics in a hyper-heuristic framework. A novel multi-method hyper-heuristic algorithm which makes use of a number of common meta-heuristics is presented. Algorithm performance is evaluated on a diverse set of real parameter benchmark problems and meaningful conclusions are drawn with respect to the selection of alternative low-level heuristics and the acceptance of the obtained solutions within the proposed multi-method meta-heuristic approach.

ID LEARNING TETRIS; CROSS-ENTROPY; GAMES
AB This paper investigates the applicability of swarm-based algorithms to the game of Tetris. This work proposes an approach to the problem in which neural network weight values are optimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Such an approach has not previously been demonstrated as feasible for Tetris. The reported experimental results show the learning progress of the algorithm, as well as a comparison against a hand-optimized Tetris playing algorithm. The results indicate that the Tetris agents show a continuous improvement over the course of training. Since the experimental focus was on the feasibility of the approach rather than optimizing performance, optimized PSO-based agents were found to be outperformed by the hand-optimized algorithm. However, the playing strategies of the two agents were compared and shown to be similar. The results indicate that a swarm-based approach is feasible, and warrants further investigation.

AB This paper presents a study that compares the efficacy of Neuro-Evolution (NE) versus Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for evolving Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controllers in an unsupervised adaptation process. The research objective is to ascertain which adaptive method is most appropriate for deriving agent behaviors in a competitive co-evolution pursuit-evasion task. This task requires one predator agent to capture one prey agent in a simulation where behavior adaptation is guided by an arms race of competitive co-evolution. Results indicate that NE was overall more effective at deriving pursuit and evasion behaviors according to the task performance measures defined for this study.

AB Current research reveals limited investigations into the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as robot simulators. The noise-tolerance and generalization capabilities of ANNs, however, suggest that ANNs could be well-suited to this application.
   As a result of this observation, a novel technique has been identified wherein ANNs are used as robot simulators. ANNs were employed to simulate the motion dynamics of a mobile robot steered using differential steering, as well as the interaction of two light sensors onboard the robot with a light source in its vicinity. To test the performance of the developed simulators, these simulators were used to evolve a light-approaching robotic control structure in simulation, which was subsequently transferred to the real-world robot. Results indicate that the simulation-evolved controller transferred well from simulation to the real-world robot. It could thus be deduced that ANNs show definite promise as robot simulators.

AB This paper presents the design of Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) using two Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) techniques, namely; Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Breeder Genetic Algorithm. BGA is a new form of evolutionary algorithm, which is based on the idea of survival of the fittest, but differs from the traditional Genetic Algorithm due to its artificial breeding nature. An eigenvalue based objective function is used in the design of the PSSs whereby the algorithms maximize the lowest damping ratio over specified operating conditions. For comparison purpose, the Conventional PSS (CPSS) is also included. The performance and effectiveness of the PSSs in damping the electromechanical modes is investigated. Eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations show that BGA-PSS and GA-PSS perform better than the CPSS for all the operating conditions considered except at the nominal operating condition. However, BGA-PSS performs slightly better than the GA-PSS.

ID PARTICLE SWARM
AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the overfitting behavior of particle swarm optimization (PSO) trained neural networks. Neural networks trained with PSOs using the global best, local best and Von Neumann information sharing topologies are investigated. Experiments are conducted on five classification and five time series regression problems. It is shown that differences exist in the degree of overfitting between the different topologies. Additionally, non-convergence of the swarms is witnessed, which is hypothetically attributed to the use of a bounded activation function in the neural networks. The hypothesis is supported by experiments conducted using an unbounded activation function in the neural network hidden layer, which lead to convergent swarms. Additionally this also lead to drastically reduced overfitting by the neural networks.

ID STORAGE/RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
AB In this work, we first propose an NP-hard combinatorial problem, that is, the storage and retrieve (S/R) machine travel path optimization for batch order picking (BOP). Successful solving this problem is valuable to many application areas such inventory items in logistics and work-in-process storage in manufacturing systems. And then, we investigate the feasibility of using ant colony optimization (ACO) meta-heuristics to address the proposed problem. Simulation tests are executed separately based on two ACO algorithms. Finally, the S/R machine operating performance measure index such as total travel distance and total travel time are employed to evaluate the experimental results achieved by different ACO algorithms. Experimental case study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of the selected ACO approaches to our proposed BOP problem.

ID AD HOC NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; CAPACITY
AB This paper investigates the performance effects of packet depletion on multihop wireless networks. The resulting capacity usage inefficiencies of link assigned schedules are shown even at the maximum supportable uniform network load. Hybrid node-link assignment is employed to extend transmission rights, allowing nodes to transmit on sets of reserve links when the primary scheduled link experiences packet depletion.
   Improvements in network performance with the extension of transmission rights are shown for proportionally fair cross-layer optimized link assigned schedules. The achievable capacity of spatial reuse networks affected by packet depletion is defined in a new rate region and a computationally feasible suboptimum is proposed. Cross-layer optimization in this rate region demonstrates further improvements in network throughput and fairness. The hybrid assignment facilitates network coding and the increased benefits thereof are shown for schedules optimized in the proposed rate region.

DE Handover Coordination; Handover Delay; Packet Loss; PMIPv6-HC
AB Next generation wireless networks will consist of interworking heterogeneous wireless access technologies that will be integrated over an IP-based infrastructure to provide network access ubiquity. In such a networking environment mobility particularly vertical handover between the heterogeneous wireless networks has to be supported. However, it is challenging to coordinate vertical handover within this diverse environment to ensure better handover performance in terms of handover delay and packet loss. Consequently, this paper proposes the idea of employing a handover coordinator between the heterogeneous networks that are affected in the handover process. The main idea is that dynamically coordinating handover procedures ahead of time among the affected networks will enhance overall handover performance. That is, coordinated handover procedures will be easy to handle proactively thus mitigating delays and packet loss during the actual handover period. The proposed handover coordinator utilizes a network-based mobility management protocol as a basis to effectively and efficiently handle vertical handovers in a localized heterogeneous wireless environment. Thus, the resulting network-based handover mechanism improves performance particularly in terms of ensuring that the handover between the heterogeneous wireless networks is transparent to active connections during the handover period. Simulation results show that handover coordination in network-based mobility managed heterogeneous wireless networks further reduces handover delay and packet loss hence improving handover performance.

AB Existing wireless networks typically support mobility by routing via a mobility anchor in a home network, but such via routing can result in non-optimized routes. This paper proposes a method to distribute the functions of the mobility anchor to different networks to avoid such non-optimized routes. It proposes a distributed mobility anchors architecture consisting of home mobility anchors (H-MA) at the home networks and visited mobility anchors (V-MA) at the visited networks. It splits the functions of a mobility anchor into the logical functions of: (1) home network prefixes allocation, (2) location management (LM), and (3) mobility routing (MR). The V-MA performs MR function to avoid triangle routing problem in Proxy mobile IP, whereas the H-MA also performs the LM function. The needed location information of a mobile node (MN) is acquired by a V-MA from the H-MA only when a packet is first sent to the MN via the V-MA and are then cached at the V-MA to enable optimized MR for packets subsequently sent to the MN.

   Markov chain; mobile terminal
AB A heterogeneous wireless network supporting multihoming gives multi-mode terminals the flexibility to be simultaneously connected to more than one radio access technologies (RATs). Existing joint call admission control (JCAC) algorithms designed for heterogeneous wireless networks block or drop an incoming call when none of the available individual RATs in the heterogeneous network has enough bandwidth to support the incoming call. Consequently, high bandwidth-demanding calls can easily be blocked or dropped in the network, especially during the peak hours. In order to reduce this problem of call blocking/dropping, this paper proposes a JCAC algorithm that selects multiple RATs for an incoming call when none of the available individual RATs has enough bbu to accommodate the incoming call. Selection of multiple RATs for an incoming call entails that the packet stream of the incoming call will be split among the selected RATs. The aim of the proposed JCAC algorithm is to admit an incoming call (that cannot be admitted into any of the available single RATs because of high load in the RATs) into two or more RATs. The residual bandwidths in the selected RATs are combined to support the incoming call, and the packet stream of the call is split among the selected RATs, thereby reducing call blocking/dropping probability. At the receiver, the split packet streams are then combined. An analytical model is developed for the proposed JCAC algorithm, and its performance is evaluated in terms of call blocking/dropping probability. Simulation results show that the JCAC algorithm reduces call blocking/dropping probability in heterogeneous wireless networks supporting multihoming.

AB Internet worms pose a major threat to Internet infrastructure security, and their destruction causes loss of millions of dollars. Therefore, the networks must be pro-tected as much as possible to avoid losses. In this paper we propose accurate system for signature generation for Zero-day polymorphic worms. We have designed a novel double-honeynet system, which is able to detect new worms that have not been seen before. We apply Princi-pal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the most significant substrings that are shared between po-lymorphic worm instances. The experimental results show that the PCA has successfully detected polymorphic worms with zero false positives and zero false negatives.

AB For any prime p and n >= 3, we examine p-ary linear codes generated by incidence matrices of two classes of graphs, H-n and Gamma(n) where Hn-1 is an induced subgraph of Gamma(n).Gamma(n) is a subgraph of the union of the categorical product of triangular graphs T-n and complete graphs K-n, and complements of triangular graphs (T) over bar (n) and K-n, where the union of graphs is as defined in [4]. For the codes of H-n, we exhibit permutation decoding sets of order n for full error correction. Their size is only twice the lower bound due to Gordon [7]. We also consider partial permutation decoding for the binary codes from Gamma(n)

DE Age classification; gender classification; support vector machines
AB We present a novel approach to automatic speaker age classification, which combines regression and classification to achieve competitive classification accuracy on telephone speech. Support vector machine regression is used to generate finer age estimates, which are combined with the posterior probabilities of well-trained discriminative gender classifiers to predict both the age and gender of a speaker. We show that this combination performs better than direct 7-class classifiers. The regressors and classifiers are trained using long-term features such as pitch and formants, as well as short-term (frame-based) features derived from MAP adaptation of GMMs that were trained on MFCCs.

AB The existing optimal training solutions for wireless multicarrier communication are not applicable to dynamic spectrum access systems as they do not take into account the restrictions on pilot subcarrier placement or the interference impact on the channel estimation performance. In such a case the problem of optimal pilot-assisted multicarrier transmission has to be reformulated, taking into account deactivated subcarriers and second-order interference statistics. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm to construct a suboptimal pilot pattern, which minimises channel estimation error variance and can incorporate any restrictions on the transmit subcarriers.

DE MIMO-OFDM systems; BICM; iterative channel estimation; channel impulse
   response estimation; fading channel
AB Iterative Decision Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) scheme is proposed in this paper for bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM)-based MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed scheme employs Variable Step Size Normalized Least Mean Square (VSSNLMS) algorithm to implement its temporary Channel Transfer Function (CTF) Estimator and Adaptive Channel Impulse Response (CIR) predictor modules, while Fast Data Projection Method (FDPM) algorithm is employed to track the time domain CIR of the MIMO channel. The proposed iterative DDCE operates in an iterative mode in conjunction with MIMO demappers and the Turbo decoder at receiver of the MIMO-OFDM system. The achievable performances of the proposed scheme in terms of both mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) are presented. Comparative performances between the DDCE scheme employing FDPM algorithm and another one employing deflated Projection Approximation Subspace Tracking (PASTd) algorithm are also given. The simulations results presented indicate better performances of the proposed scheme.

AB In this article, we attempt to solve cellular manufacturing system (CMS) scheduling problem from group technology point of view. Since the operations of a job in a CMS can be performed on more than one machine within a cell, the scheduling problem of the CMS is always considered as a computationally hard problem. Two approaches called fuzzy logic and fuzzy MAX-MIN ant system are employed respectively. Under the consideration of multiple criteria, the performance of different manufacturing cells in a CMS is improved by means of proposed methodologies.

AB In this paper we present a topological map building algorithm based on a Vocabulary Tree that is robust to features present in dynamic or similar environments. The algorithm recognises incorrect loop closures, not supported by the odometry, and uses this information to update the feature weights in the tree to suppress further associations from these features. Two methods of adjusting these feature entropies are proposed, one decreasing entropy related to incorrect features in a uniform manner and the other proportional to the contribution of the said feature. Preliminary results showing the performance of the proposed method are presented where it is found that by adjusting the feature entropies, the number of incorrect associations can be reduced while improving the quality of the correct matches.

AB We propose a more robust robot programming by demonstration system planner that produces a reproduction path which satisfies statistical constraints derived from demonstration trajectories and avoids obstacles given the freedom in those constraints. To determine the statistical constraints a Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted to demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are recorded through kinesthetic teaching of a redundant manipulator. The GMM models the likelihood of configurations given time. The planner is based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree search with the search tree kept within the statistical model. Collision avoidance is included by not allowing the tree to grow into obstacles. The system is designed to act as a backup for a faster reactive planner that may fall into a local minimum.
   To illustrate its performance an experiment is conducted where the system is taught to open a Pelican case using a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). During reproduction an obstacle is placed nearby the case to partially obstruct the manipulator. The planner successfully avoided this obstacle without drifting from the trend in the demonstrations.

AB An automated land cover change detection method is proposed that uses coarse resolution hyper-temporal satellite time series data. The study compared two different unsupervised clustering approaches that operate on the short term Fourier transform coefficients of subsequences of 8-day composite MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data that were extracted with a temporal sliding window. The method uses a feature extraction process that creates meaningful sequential time series that can be analyzed and processed for change detection. The method was evaluated on real and simulated land cover change examples and obtained a change detection accuracy higher than 76% on real land cover conversion and more than 70% on simulated land cover conversion.

ID UNSUPERVISED CHANGE DETECTION
AB A method for detecting land cover change using NDVI time-series data derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data is proposed. The algorithm acts as a per pixel change alarm and takes as input the NDVI time-series of a 3x3 grid of MODIS pixels. An Extended Kalman Filter was used to estimate a series of parameters related to each NDVI signal. A spatial comparison between the center pixel of the the 3x3 grid and each of its neighboring pixels' parameters was done to calculate a change metric which compared to a threshold yielded a change or no-change decision. The method was tested on real change examples in the study area and results indicate 90% detection of new settlements occurring in naturally vegetated areas.

AB Previous work has shown the ability of waveform LiDAR sensors to accurately describe various land cover types [1] and biomass estimates made in the field [2]. What is lacking, however, is a way to describe the different structural components that are embedded in the digitized backscattered energy from the LiDAR pulse. This study aims to extract structural components from waveform LiDAR data in terms of woody, herbaceous, and bare ground components from data collected over a savanna environment in and around Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. These components are comprised of metrics extracted from the waveforms and validated using biomass measurements made in field plots. Different size windows around plot centers, 3x3 pixels and 9x9 pixels (resulting in 1.5m and 4.5 m footprint, respectively), were used to examine scale effects of larger footprints. It was found that composite waveforms resembling plot sizes (9x9) most often are able to describe more than 80% of the woody biomass variability across the entire study site, and individually for two of the three land uses within the area. However, the herbaceous component of the waveform did not correlate well with the field measurements, while the bare ground component was verified visually in a side-by-side comparison with optical imagery.

AB Ensemble classification involves consulting experts in taking final decision in classification process. The idea is to improve classification accuracy when the compared to their signal classifier counterpart. The system is used in remote sensing imagery to obtain information about Land cover. Major challenges associated with classification accuracy include design procedure of classifier, choice of training sets from dataset and information conveyed to the algorithm. Superiority of different classification approaches employed depends on selected dataset and the strategy used during designing phase of each classifier. However, in ensemble approach, there is no definite number of classifiers that should take part in decision making. This study exploits feature selection technique to create diversity in ensemble classification. Results obtained show that for ensemble approach, there is no significant benefit in having many base classifiers. The outcome should reveal how to design best ensemble using feature selection approach for land cover mapping.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data afford the remote sensing community a unique opportunity to investigate the frequency and distribution of fires. Previous research that validated the MODIS burned area product (MCD45A1) in South Africa was only limited to two Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) scenes in savanna vegetation, which is not adequate for robust assessment of fire distribution across diverse environments. In this study, validation of the MCD45A1 and the Backup MODIS burned area product (hereafter BMBAP) was extended over different South African vegetation types by quantifying their burned area detection and estimation accuracy using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Results from the four validation sites reveal that there are subtle differences in the accuracy of the two products. These differences could be influenced for example by, vegetation type, spectral characteristics, and size distribution of the burned areas. These results have significant implications for fire monitoring in Southern Africa.

ID AMPLIFICATION
AB We have designed, constructed and tested an electromechanical acoustic sensor as a conceptual model for the active process in the mammalian cochlea. The sensor is based on a mechanical resonator - a stretched latex band - which is tonically (tensionally) modulated by an electromechanical actuator. A feedback circuit senses the motion of the resonator, and modulates its tension at twice the frequency of its motion. An amplifier is thereby formed, which is self-tuned to the circuit's resonance, and which produces gain by regeneration and degenerate parametric pumping. The system is simple in structure; physiologically plausible as a model for the basilar membrane and associated hair cells; and reproduces several well-known features of the cochlear amplifier.

AB The first-order moment of (d, k) constrained codes is investigated in this paper. We propose a generalized moment balancing template to encode a (d, k) sequence into a single insertion or deletion correcting codeword without losing the constraint property. By relocating 0's in moment balancing runs of a (d, k) sequence, the first-order moment of this sequence can be manipulated to satisfy the Varshamov-Tenengolts construction. The moment balancing runs appear in a pairwise manner in this sequence. The lower bound of the number of balancing bits in the template is asymptotically of the same order as the universal template for random sequences, and is of a practical-interest small.

AB Measured radar data assisted in the successful development and implementation of Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) signal processing algorithms. The aim of the algorithm is the identification of a specific emitter within a single class of emitters. The processes developed are pulse extraction, feature calculation, dimensionality reduction and classification. A pulse is detected whenever the phase changes from being random to being linear. Time domain features are then calculated from these extracted pulses to populate a feature vector. Some redundancy exists in the feature vector and a process of dimensionality reduction is followed to obtain the optimum set of features. A Fuzzy ARTMAP classifier completes the process of specific emitter identification to demonstrate the improvement in Correct Classification Decisions (CCD) using the reduced feature vector.

AB The prediction of radar coverage as a function of the position of the radar has always been a key step in radar network planning. In the past, simple geometric models backed up by the deployment of siting radars were the only options for potential site evaluation, but the development of sophisticated propagation models (e. g. AREPS [1]) has moved the technology forward to another level of prediction accuracy. Modelling takes into account atmospheric refraction, as well as terrain effects and clutter. In previous papers [2], [3] we have shown that the modelling can also cater for multistatic radar systems. In this paper we have extended our modelling to give a statistical measure of the effectiveness of a site that measures the signal to noise ratio (SNR) or (for multistatic radar) the signal to interference ratio (SIR) over regions of interest. The area is pixellated into values of SNR and SIR, and pixels meeting the required SNR and / SIR are counted. We show some results for a multistatic radar. We conclude by indicating how we plan to include ground clutter. We mention how this method of obtaining quantitative coverage performance can be used with all forms of radar, and will be able to improve future networks of cognitive radars.

AB In this paper, a framework will be proposed for the evaluation of detector algorithms in a maritime environment. Performance metrics and test cases will be defined to allow the impartial comparison of different detectors. In this framework the main approaches for detector comparison are numerical simulation and the use of recorded sea clutter and boat reflectivity data. Available data suitable to the fair comparison of different algorithms will be highlighted, with results for a selection of algorithms. The proposed framework, performance metrics and baseline cases give researchers and system engineers the ability to quantify system performance in a complex clutter environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular detector (or radar design(s)) as compared to another.

AB Passive Coherent Radar (PCL) is heavily constrained by the level of direct signal illumination. This paper investigates null steering techniques for a circular array antenna. An 8-element circular array has been designed and a method is proposed to steer multiple nulls in different directions. We present computed performance for two nulls achieved simultaneously. An 8 element dipole array has been constructed and the VSWR results are presented. This antenna will form the basis of practical null formation measurements.

ID REED-MULLER CODES; POWER-CONTROL
AB In this paper, the benefits of OFDM waveforms are analyzed for multistatic radar systems, where several radar stations cooperate in the same frequency band. The signal is coded over a 2D pattern, in the time and the frequency domains, using orthogonal Golay complementary sets derived from Reed-Muller codes. Binary data are also encoded in the signal. The obtained ambiguity and cross-ambiguity functions show that the OFDM signal structure is well adapted for radar applications. Transmitted waveforms have relatively low interference and sidelobe levels in the range and Doppler axis.

AB In this paper, theory is developed for the prediction of the false alarm (P-FA) and detection (P-D) performance of surface targets in K-distributed sea clutter detected by means of Doppler processing techniques. Vital to this analysis is the inclusion of the correlation properties of the sea clutter between all the pulses within a burst of pulses. The resultant technique allows for the prediction of P-FA and P-D for each of the bins in the output of the Doppler processing stage of a fixed-threshold detector. The technique provides the ability to specify different thresholds for each of the Doppler bins. The analysis is extended to include Swerling type 1 and 2 targets for the calculation of P-D. The performance of a noncoherent detector is provided for comparison. Results that demonstrate the application of the developed theory are also presented.

AB In a previous paper [1] we mentioned that Passive Coherent Location (PCL) can be thought of as Cognitive Radar [2]. The deployment of PCL systems (also known as Passive Bistatic Radar-PBR) is fraught with difficulty, even in the situation of a spatially static network of transmitters and receivers. It is well known that PCL systems have to take into account the strong, direct signals of cooperative and opportunistic transmitters used, and try to use terrain or antenna nulls [3] to mitigate the receiver dynamic range requirements. Receiver position in the terrain also influences the coverage. This results in a complex planning environment requiring propagation prediction tools to assist in selection of the best site [4]. The situation becomes worse when the network of transmitter and receivers becomes dynamic. In this paper, we discuss the cognition and networking requirements for PCL systems consisting of moving transmitters and receivers, forming a cognitive, sensor network. We show that a sensible approach would use the structure of human intelligence, which consists of a higher level integrating function, together with autonomic [5], lower level, subsystems.

AB In this paper, a reduced complexity soft-input soft-output MIMO detector is presented. The detector is intended to be used in conjunction with an error correction code. The detector combines a Sphere Decoder with a Hopfield network to calculate a max-log-map approximation. It is then combined with the error correction code in an iterative structure (turbo). The code used is a quasi-cyclic non-binary LDPC code. The simulation results demonstrate that with less computational complexity, the proposed system's performance equals that of an optimal sphere decoder based detector.

DE Handover delay; Handover coordinator; Packet loss; Signaling overhead
AB In next generation mobile networks where heterogeneous but complementary wireless networks will coexist and combine resources to provide ubiquitous access to internet services, vertical handover needs to be executed seamlessly to ensure that active service sessions are not disrupted during mobility events. Seamless handover, which should be non-perceptible to the mobile user, can be experienced if the handover latency and packet losses during the handover period are negligible. Various mobility management protocols have been proposed and standardized to support mobility across heterogeneous networks but they do not provide seamless handover in their current form. In this paper, we propose to utilize and optimize Proxy Mobile IPv6 with a Handover Coordinator, which is a network-based entity, to further improve handover performance in terms of packet loss, handover delay and signaling overhead in a micromobility domain. Thus, we introduce a new approach of performing seamless and soft handover among heterogeneous wireless networks. An in depth analysis of the proposed architectural handover mechanism is presented and the conclusion from analytical and simulation results shows that handover delay and packet loss are reduced without incurring signaling overhead in the air interface.

DE Session continuity; WiMAX; session transfer; IMS; testbed; WiFi;
   multimedia
AB The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity is a recent effort by 3GPP towards achieving an enhanced mobility experience for IMS subscribers. It provides mechanisms to manage continuity of IMS services, particularly the seamless transfer of multimedia sessions across different access networks, different domains, and the mobility of ongoing sessions across devices of the same user. Functionally, it is mobility management at the IMS services and applications layer when terminal and session mobility events are visible to the IMS. Although mobility management is a thoroughly explored and extensively documented area of research, the approach has not always been service-oriented, whereby users are able to actually subscribe to the provisioning of this functionality. This is the new context introduced by IMS service continuity. There are, however, very few reports on actual implementation and specific practical evaluations of IMS service continuity. In this work, we perform a testbed implementation and evaluation of IMS service continuity. Particularly, we investigate the signaling aspects of the service in a heterogeneous wireless networks environment. We develop a prototype service continuity application server, and use it with the UCT IMS Client and the FOKUS Open IMS Core to determine the effect of service continuity signaling on end user experience.

DE Service Composition; Charging; IMS; 3rd Party Service Providers
AB In a saturating telecommunications marketplace network operators want to rapidly deploy services with minimum capital investment, while maximizing on revenue from service usage by customers. One way to achieve this is to create interfaces for 3rd party service and content providers to offer their applications and services to users. Composing and bundling of these services will essentially create new services for the user and achieve rapid deployment of enhanced services. Effective accounting of service usage requires mechanisms for billing and charging of these services. Achieving this in an environment where the network operator interacts directly with the 3rd party service providers may become complicated. This work defines a framework that would allow for the effective charging and billing of services composed from 3rd party service and content providers. We propose the use of a service composer who mediates between an IMS network operator and the many content providers to create new services that are composed from independent applications; the composer simplifies the technical and business aspects of service provision while ensuring that charging and billing occurs within the network.

AB Avalanche electroluminescence offers the opportunity for standard CMOS devices to be used as light emitters. Although inefficient, avalanche breakdown is inherently a fast process and potentially offers benefits in terms of speed when compared to emission based on forward biased junctions. Furthermore, the wide spectral characteristics of avalanche electroluminescence in the visible range also allows for some interesting applications. The main obstacle suppressing the use of these silicon light emitters in mainstream applications is inefficient radiative recombination. A number of techniques are known to improve quantum efficiency, one of which is operating the devices in punch through mode. This work focuses on improved results obtained from punch through devices, manipulation of the oxide above the radiative action and interesting results pertaining to the radiation pattern and the effects of LOCOS structures on the emission shape. This information could potentially benefit optical coupling to the light sources.

AB This paper discusses the design of Power System Stabilizers PSSs) using an Adaptive Mutation Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) and Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). BGA is a new form of evolutionary algorithm. It uses the same idea of survival of the fittest like the Genetic Algorithms, however unlike GA; BGA uses the concept of artificial breeding, whereby the offspring takes the best characteristics from the parents. PBIL is an abstraction of genetic algorithm, which explicitly maintains the key components contained in GA's population, but abstracts away the crossover operator and redefines the role of population. The paper compares the performance and effectiveness of the PSSs in damping the electromechanical modes. In evaluating the different methods, an eigenvalue based objective function was used in the design of the PSSs whereby the algorithm maximizes the lowest damping ratio over specified operating conditions. Eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations show that the systems equipped with BGA-PSS and PBIL - PSS perform very closely. It is also shown that BGA and PBIL based PSSs perform better that the Conventional PSS (CPSS) at all the operating conditions considered except at the nominal operating condition where the CPSS was tuned.

AB A BiCMOS Silicon Germanium cross-coupled differential-pair narrowband voltage controlled oscillator with a tail-current shaping technique to improve phase noise performance is implemented and experimental results are presented. Several VCOs are fabricated on-chip to serve for a practical comparison and the results are also compared to simulated results. Simulation results provided a 3.3 dBc/Hz improvement from -105.3 dBc/Hz to -108.6 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset frequency from the 5 GHz carrier. Measured results confirm the correlation of phase noise performance between simulation and prototype. Acceptable phase noise performance compared to previous works is achieved using a relatively cost-effective technology.

AB Experimentation appears to be an ideal context in which several key aspects of scientific thinking can be addressed. However, the traditional freshman laboratory does not appear to be successful in doing so. This paper argues that this has much, to do with the way in which tasks are formulated. We propose a simple descriptive model based on the notion of the "idea space" that can be used to analyze task formulation that can promote meaningful critical thinking. A number of factors that affect the size of the idea space are discussed, such as conceptual metaphor and the perceived nature of questioning from a socio-cultural perspective, described in terms of knowledge and information flow.

AB Manufacturing systems of the next generation will have to incorporate more flexibility and intelligence, evolving towards reconfigurable manufacturing systems. The concept of 'intelligence' becomes increasingly relevant because of the need to maintain effective and efficient manufacturing operations with minimum downtime even under conditions of uncertainty. Interest in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) research has grown in recent years. This paper discusses the development of an Intelligent Maintenance Management System (IMMS) making use of Multi-Agent Systems. This system has been simulated using a planning simulation tool known as the Drools Planner.

   Logistics regression
AB This study develops a model that attempts to mine advanced fee fraud activities through internet based emails correspondence for the purpose of forensic investigation. We extract various email document stylometrics, header and textural body content features that are used with support vector machine and Logistics regression machine learning algorithms to classify email documents into binary categories. Automatic word clustering algorithm is applied to partition a set of distinct words into clusters of semantically similar words to achieve space dimension reduction and classification efficiency. The classification accuracies of support vector machine and Logistics regression are compared. The results of this comparison show that the mean accuracy for support vector machine (M=95.20, SD=2.85) is not significantly different from the mean accuracy for Logistics regression (M=93.70, SD=2.51) using two sample t test for equal variance. Conclusively, support vector machine and Logistics regression are useful machine learning algorithms for identifying advanced fee fraud activities on the internet.

ID MULTICOMPONENT DISTILLATION
AB Distillation has a particularly high potential for energy savings, as it accounts for around 40-70% of capital and operating costs in petrochemical and commodity industries. However, numerous existing techniques that have been proposed to facilitate the design often lack the robustness and reliability needed to rigorously solve the problem, largely due to simplifying assumptions. In this contribution, we present computational methods which exploit a novel thermodynamically motivated problem transformation, entitled temperature collocation, rather than using classical tray-by-tray models which fail in pinched regions. This novel methodology applies to ideal, non-ideal and azeotropic mixtures, and is independent of the number of components. Due to the generalised nature of the method, we have also addressed the synthesis of complex column configurations as well as heat integration of distillation trains. Furthermore, the robust synthesis algorithm is presented, a method that automatically synthesizes a distillation network for given product purity requirements. Entire separation flowsheets are generated with rigorous thermodynamic models without the need to introduce limiting simplifications as is the case with existing shortcut techniques. The computational approach guarantees to identify realizable columns with a finite number of trays and operating conditions, which may easily be validated with industrial flowsheet simulator software packages like AspenPlus.

AB Published arguments, which assign dominant roles to atomic metastability and molecular ion dissociation in the production of 'narrow' Zeeman component Balmer line radiation from the tokamak edge plasma, have been examined critically in relation to: l-redistribution by proton collisions, molecular ion-proton equipartition, and ion acceleration by the plasma sheath (scrape-off layer) potential. These processes are found to constrain the contributions from metastable atoms and from dissociative excitation of molecular ions to 'narrow' Balmer spectra emitted from the plasma edge, in relation to the corresponding contributions from electron impact-induced dissociative excitation of neutral molecules.

AB OPEN-GAIN project's aim is to supply fresh water and electricity to rural remote communities not connected to the public grid, using the renewable energies and the reverse osmosis desalination technique. In this paper, the system used is described and several scenarios were investigated in the simulation to compare the PV only and Wind only systems with the hybrid system. The simulations were carried out using HOMER tool provided by NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory). The results show that the combination of PV and WT power generators, with batteries, allows obtaining a better renewable energy fraction of 95%.

AB Purpose of the study: To provide an evaluative report of a training course in dementia caregiving. The course was presented over a period of six days, and aimed to educate caregivers on various aspects of dementia. Method: The evaluation process was qualitative in design. Information was obtained from a literature review and the training manual of the course. The evaluator attended the course to observe participants and evaluate the course content. Data collection took place by means of pre- and post-evaluation procedures, namely personal interviews, focus group discussions, and the completion of daily expectation-and evaluation sheets. Findings: Dementia is a phenomenon that is not easily understood by untrained caregivers, especially those from a traditional African perspective. Being untrained complicates the caregiver's task. Training improved coping in the workplace as well as the quality of the caring. The course empowered the caregivers and made them feel valued and important. Training was beneficial for both the caregiver and the patient. The care facilities as well as the direct family members drew benefit from having personnel who are better trained.

AB Purpose of the study: To develop and implement an integrated activity programme, custom-designed for demented patients in mild and moderate stages of the condition and who are based in long-term care facilities in the Free State, South Africa. Method: The study was qualitative in design, allowing the researcher to gather information within the actual environment of a dementia unit situated at a long-term care facility. An inductive exploratory study was conducted where the effect of certain activities and techniques was observed and interaction monitored to identify which activities enhance interaction and activity. Data was analysed through content analysis drawn from observations. Suitable activities were selected on the discretion of the researcher and caregivers. Findings: Although it is assumed that persons with dementia benefit from being involved in meaningful activity, the way in which individuals with dementia perceive this involvement is poorly understood. The study in question found that each person challenged by dementia remains a distinctive individual with unique needs and preferences. Results proved that different activities are enjoyed in the various stages of dementia and that prescribed therapeutic activities are not suited for every dementia case. The individualism of the patient needs to be valued.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DEMENTIA; DIAGNOSIS
AB Purpose of the study: The study aimed at identifying the challenges associated with clinical interviewing and cognitive assessment as part of dementia research in a rural South African community. Method: Fourteen (14) healthcare workers (registered nurses) were interviewed during the pilot phase (N=230) of a cross-sectional whole population survey on the prevalence of dementia in a rural Sesotho-speaking community in South Africa. They responded to a structured questionnaire which elicited responses pertaining to: i) interviewing time; ii) communication difficulties; iii) translated text; iv) colloquialism; v) local custom; vi) interviewer burden; and vii) burden on interviewee. Findings: Clinical interviewing time proved to be significantly longer than estimated in the research protocol. Observing local custom as well as low levels of participant literacy added to interviewer burden. Translated clinical constructs and medical/psychiatric terminology were problematic in terms of descriptive range. Cognitive assessments (i.e. memory assessments) may yield a high percentage of false negatives due to interviewing time and burden on both the interviewer and interviewee. The interview structure was difficult to maintain within the context of local ethnic customs and social graces.

DE Supercontinuum generation; all-normal dispersion fibers; photonic
   crystal fiber; nanofiber; suspended core fiber
AB We numerically investigate supercontinuum (SC) generation in fibers with all-normal group velocity dispersion (GVD) under femtosecond pumping, including photonic crystal fibers (PCF), optical nanofibers and suspended core PCF. It is shown that all-normal dispersion (ANDi) fibers are ideally suited to generate extremely flat and more than octave spanning SC spectra which are highly coherent over the entire bandwidth. Due to the suppression of soliton fission in the normal GVD regime, the SC spectra are mainly generated by self-phase modulation and optical wave breaking dynamics, resulting in smooth spectral profiles without significant fine structure. A single pulse is maintained in the time domain, which can be externally compressed to the few-cycle regime. We present specific design examples of ANDi PCF for pumping at 1080 nm and extend the concept to optical nanofibers for deep ultraviolet (UV) SC generation at 400 nm pump wavelength as well as tapered suspended core PCF for visible and near UV SC generation at 465 nm and 530 nm pump wavelength. First "proof of principle" experiments confirm the basic findings of the numerical simulations and show the feasibility of the proposed SC generation scheme.

ID QUALITY; SATISFACTION
AB The purpose of this study is to investigate selective service quality elements that contribute to the satisfaction of passengers when making use of domestic airlines in South Africa and to compare the results with a similar investigation in Italy. The expectations of passengers on service quality in the domestic airline industry is vital in understanding areas of success and areas of failure in South Africa and Italy on specific performance areas. Airline passengers qualified to be part of the survey by answering confirmative that they have travelled by means of any domestic airline in the respective country during the last 12 months. Three hundred and forty one respondents agreed to be interviewed in the Tshwane region of South Africa and one hundred in the Verona district of Italy. The questionnaire dealt with aspects such as demographic information, other airline related issues as well as expectations of pre determined service quality variables that relates to a domestic airline. The latter was measured on a seven point scale. Personal interviews were conducted with the respondents by means of a self completion questionnaire that was drawn up in English and Italian. Data was captured by a trained assistant and analysed by using the SPSS version 17 statistical package.
   The main findings is that special attention to passengers on board the aircraft, the quality of food on board, when available and special offers for frequent flyers are amongst the most important issues related to three categories, namely the cabin crew's capabilities, the food and beverage service and the promotional issues. As this research under represent leisure travelers, it is recommended the research should be expanded to include this market segment in order to determine the feasibility of introducing more charter flights aimed at the leisure target market which may create greater possibilities for consolidation of bookings in order to manage low bookings economically, merging of flights, higher utilisation of aircraft and more choice of destination and departure times. The research shall result in improved management of service quality associated with the airline industry in South Africa and Italy. The outcomes of the research will result in the sustainable management of pre-selected service quality elements associated with the airline industry with specific reference to airline passengers. The paper reveals some information about the differences in expectations of South African and Italian passengers and shed light on mainly in-cabin and communication variables.

ID EXAM PERFORMANCE; ATTENDANCE
AB Financial Accounting 188 is a compulsory first-year module for all BComm degrees at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, with an annual average of 1 300 students. The throughput rate of traditionally below 75% is a cause for concern at both a departmental and institutional level, which prompted an investigation into student success in the module. This paper presents the results of the process of establishing a profile of successful and at-risk students in this particular module. A two-step process was followed to achieve the goals of the study.
   Firstly, the significance of a number of factors influencing students' ability to succeed was statistically tested (by employing univariate techniques) to determine the possible correlation between specific factors and students' success. For all the categorical factors, two-way cross-tabulation tables were prepared. Univariate logistic regressions were done on the ordinal factors. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were done to describe the contribution of the factors in predicting success in the module.
   The most important factors in determining success of students in the module include average Grade 12 mark, whether students had Accounting as a subject at secondary school, class attendance, home language (Afrikaans or English), and the programme within which students were enrolled.
   In the second step of the research, the simultaneous effect of all these factors was determined by means of a multivariate technique, CART (classification and regression tree), to derive a profile of successful and at-risk students. An at-risk Financial Accounting 188 student profile in the study cohort was a student:
   with an average Grade 12 mark below 74.15% and no prior background in Accounting;
   who attended less than 51% of classes;
   whose home language is English; and
   who enrolled for a BComm general degree.
   The results of this study can be used at faculty level by considering entrance requirements for BComm degrees or, alternatively, at institutional level in determining language policy. At micro-level, the results will be used to provide interventions in Financial Accounting 188 itself, to address specific risk areas. Students will be stratified in the first week of classes. Focused mentor groups and tutorials will be provided for students below the cut-off points as identified above. In this manner irrelevant and time-consuming efforts on interventions and actions which might be worthless in the pursuit of student success in the module can be avoided. The results provide insight into the significantly predictive factors that may influence first-year students' success within the particular module. This insight may facilitate a more learner-centred ethos through the development of student support systems and teaching practices based on an empirically founded notion of student success. The results are not generalisable beyond the module, but are significant in informing similar studies in other modules.

DE Primary Health Care Delivery; Physiotherapy; Clinical training; Practice
AB The delivery of primary health care (PHC) as promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and in South Africa, is of fundamental importance for the promotion of health care. Physiotherapy is an essential component of the health care delivery system and must promote PHC during clinical training and practice. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), PHC service delivery has been a challenge for various reasons, inter alia, the history of the country (apartheid era pre-1994), financial constraints, lack of human resources, physical infrastructure and time constraints. Poor service delivery within the health sector is reported frequently in the media. In the latter part of 2009 Physiotherapists and Radiographers in KZN embarked on a strike highlighting that they were overworked, due to vacancies not being filled, poor conditions of service and inadequate remuneration.
   The aim of the research was to explore the promotion of PHC delivery in KZN. The objectives explored the empowerment of students and staff in the Health Science Disciplines in PHC service delivery. In addition, managers at provincial and local levels in the health sector were included in the study. Barriers and factors that enhance the promotion of PHC were identified. The research design comprised of a survey, a quantitative and qualitative case study of KZN, using questionnaires or semi-structured interviews. Purposive, stratified sampling was used to select health care staff, managers and students that complied with set inclusion criteria, and were willing to participate in the study. The sample (N=180) included various strata or subgroups from a range of professions namely, Physiotherapy, Optometry, Occupational Therapy, Nursing, Medicine and Social Work. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was rigorously tested by pre-pilot as well as pilot studies. Excel spreadsheet and SPSS statistical packages were used to assist in data capture and quantitative analysis. Data analysis included the Cronbach's Alpha, Chi-Square, Fisher;s Exact, Mann Whitney, ANOVA and the Kriskal Walis test. Qualitative data in the form of open-ended questions in the survey was captured using coding or content analysis by identifying similar and different responses to enable interpretation of raw data. The analysis/interpretation of results by triangulating quantitative and qualitative data enabled the presentation of the findings.
   The findings indicated that the Physiotherapy staff lacked PHC training (p=0.000); and 48.7% of the Disciplines in Health Sciences indicated that rural needs were not being addressed with regard to PHC service delivery (p=0.018). Each discipline operated within its own silo, without any consultation and inter-disciplinary collaboration, to the detriment of effective delivery of PHC services. Fragmentation and duplication of PHC services existed between Provincial and Local Governments as indicated by 46% of the managers, which is disconcerting post 16 years of democracy in South Africa. The main objective of the National Health Plan and Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was to redress the inequalities and fragmented health services. The plethora of recommendations that emanated should improve the journey towards transformation; a comprehensive PHC service delivery; and in the improvement of the quality of life for all South Africans.

AB This article examines the use of virtual interactions in a Communication class at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) - South Africa. It seeks to demonstrate how synthesising virtual and other computer-assisted exercises and traditional classroom-based activities can enhance the teaching and learning of communication concepts. The article is based on the experiences of first year Information Technology (IT) students in the Faculty of Informatics and Design at CPUT and the data was gleaned from observations, questionnaires and course reflections during one semester of an academic year. The article argues that despite the burgeoning interest in computer-centered teaching and learning at CPUT, traditional methods of teaching are still valuable given the differences in the learning styles and technological experiences of its students. In this light, the article proposes 'complementarity' as the most expedient approach because it can cater for the diversity in this learning space as well as promote quality peer interactions and collaborative learning. It can also transform the process of learning into an invigorating experience especially since this cohort of students is dispassionate about Communication.

DE barriers to learning; Inclusive education; literacy
AB The main purpose of any education system is to provide quality education for all learners so that they will be able to reach their full potential and be able to meaningfully contribute to and participate in that society throughout their lives (Education White Paper 6, 2001). There are two distinct categories of learners in our country. That is, those learners who form the majority with "ordinary needs" and a small minority of learners with "special needs" (learners experiencing barriers to learning) who require support in order to engage in some form of learning process. Barriers to learning are not caused by a single factor but it has multifaceted factors. Within the South African context these factors can be classified into two main categories, that is, socio-economic barriers and educational barriers. In South Africa effective access to education is prevented as a result of these barriers, which reflects a deficient system and not a deficient learner. As South Africans, learners have a right to be educated in an inclusive classroom as is acknowledged in the constitution of our country.
   The purpose of this paper is to show a correlation between the low literacy levels and barriers to learning. My main aim is to focus on the nature of these barriers, what causes them and how they manifest themselves. Only then, can we begin to address problems of learning breakdown and ongoing exclusions. I will also discuss the different barriers to learning that hinder teaching and learning in South Africa. Educators must be made aware of the fact that the one-size-fits all approach is no longer workable and they must be able to recognise the diverse needs of the struggling learners and underachievers.

DE Secondary Education; Student Leadership; Servant Leadership; Community
   Building
AB Significant changes have taken place in recent years in leadership theory and practice world wide. Theorizations of effective leadership have evolved from being authoritarian and task-centred to a model in which leaders are encouraged to look beyond their self-interest and prioritize the interests of the group.
   This study investigates the development of an alternative form of leadership through community building in two male school boarding houses. It attempts to ascertain whether students are able to work collaboratively towards developing an environment conducive to servant leadership.
   "The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. "[1]
   Structured according to the transformative research paradigm, this action research study was conducted in a South African, traditional, independent, co-educational school that prides itself on producing leaders. The school is in the process of reviewing its leadership system, and it became an appropriate site to investigate the development of community and to explore possibilities for the emergence of an alternative form of leadership that would reflect the attributes of servant leadership.
   The study attempts to critically analyse the influence of existing traditional structures in the exercise of leadership necessary to run the boarding establishment. The approach is interactive in so far as it is based on a relationship between the knower and the would-be knower (i.e. the researcher and the participants) [2]. Harding (1993)[2] usefully recommends a methodology that involves consulting those who are marginalized, as this helps to reveal more about the unexamined assumptions that influence the way of life of a given community.
   The participants in the study were volunteers from two Houses, who agreed to reflect on their perceptions and experiences of the way in which their Houses functioned.
   The research findings show that through their willingness to engage in moral dialogue, students can transform their Houses into closely-knit communities bound together by shared values and beliefs. Closer relationships make for better understanding. As the leaders take on the responsibility of caring for their juniors, a moral obligation begins to manifest itself. Leaders will display the attributes of servant leadership if they are prepared to acknowledge in practice this moral obligation to serve others.

DE Education in Lesotho; Hlotse; causes of failure in Form E
AB Lesotho was a British colony until 1886. Consequently, Lesotho has adopted Britain's Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC) for their Senior Secondary education (which includes Form E as its final year). For many years the failure rate among Form E (matriculation) learners in Lesotho has been very high.
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors which cause the high failure rate among Form E learners in Hlotse, a town in the Leribe district of Lesotho. Twenty five teachers from five different high schools participated in the study. A questionnaire was distributed to all twenty five participants, and interviews were conducted with them. A qualitative interpretive approach was followed. It was found that the lack of teaching and learning materials, poor teaching approaches and the irrelevant curriculum were the major causes of the high failure rate among Form E learners in the Hlotse schools. Other factors included poor command of English, poverty, irregular school attendance by learners and inadequate revision or preparation of learners for the examinations. In order to improve pass rates among Form E learners, the Lesotho government has to provide adequate resources required for effective teaching and learning, improve teaching skills through in-service training, and provide education content that is relevant to the economic and social needs of the Basotho.

DE teacher stress; black township schools; teachers' circumstances
AB This study investigated the relationship between the different circumstances of the township secondary school teachers and their stress situation. Eight personal and work circumstances (also called categories) were identified. These categories included gender, age, marital status, the number of periods taught per week and the number of grades taught per week. A questionnaire was developed, and administered on 368 teachers from 36 township secondary schools from the Free State Province. Eight hypotheses were developed in relation to the eight categories. The hypotheses were investigated by means of the chi-square test. The items that dealt with the stressors of township secondary school teachers were 115. By means of factor analysis the 115 items were reduced to 22 factors. These factors were named. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine relationships between stress and the different categories. It was found that the individual teachers' circumstances may have an influence on the level of stress experienced. Therefore, in order to reduce stress experienced by townships secondary school teachers, the school manager could change the work circumstances of these teachers.

DE Innovation; change; indeterminacy; improvisation; change
AB Do our teaching philosophies, methodologies and pedagogies, lesson plans and research methods, indeed, our mindsets, allow for the following modes of thinking and action: Indeterminacy, improvisation and innovation?
   In this paper I argue for the development of a creative and innovative culture of teaching, learning and research by design; for extending knowledge through research, teaching or service to the direct benefit of external social partners by 'writing' new curricula that "expand the intellectual horizons and critical faculties of our students," (Nzimande; 2010), encourage practice-based approaches to teaching, learning and research, and that address real world problems by extending interactions with local and global communities.
   I propose post-Outcomes Based Education curriculum reform, and in particular a Curriculum for Innovation, as a method for navigating the indeterminacy, uncertainty and fluidity of the higher education landscape and for responding to a world of constant change. It is my contention that giving equal weight to both visual and written components in practice-based teaching and learning interventions, as well as practice-based academic inquiry, could create new teaching and learning possibilities and a diversified curriculum that is better-aligned with the world of work.
   Bearing this in mind, I suggest that visual documentation i.e. personal, practice-based narratives in the form of teaching and learning portfolios and reflective journals emanating from one's own personal, workplace experiences and observations - be it in the lecture hall or design studio - would not only effectively address the dominance of language-as-text in academic discourse, but could, at the same time, "provide the labour market in a knowledge driven and knowledge dependent society, with the ever changing high-level competencies and expertise necessary for the growth and prosperity of a modern economy."

AB The aim of this article is to explore the views held by educators on learner leadership in rural secondary schools. The argument is presented that learner leadership is a critical component of education in the new democratic dispensation in South Africa. The South African Schools Act provides for greater participation by learners in the democratic functioning of schools
   The article reports on a study in which quantitative methodology was used to obtain information from educators about their perceptions of learner leadership in rural secondary schools
   The study is concluded by the submission that it is essential for rural secondary schools to establish learner leadership structures and give these structures necessary training so that they can have a working knowledge of school governance as their participation involves among other things planning, organising, leading, supervision, decision-making, controlling, and coordinating which are some of the management duties of the school governance structures.

DE challenges; African researchers; universities; rating; funding
AB Research is a prerequisite for the success and credibility of any academic institution around the globe. This is even more so for an institution of higher education whose mandate is primarily to produce new knowledge and impart new skills to its student population while also influencing national and international policies. In line with this trajectory, it is irrefutable that the university community, particularly academics and those who occupy management positions should be constantly engaged in research. It is through such an endeavour that they could set a good example to both the students and younger academics. However, this does not always happen. Some universities have a very high research output and therefore receive high accolades while others are almost non-existent in the national and international ratings. The question is: Why is this the case? Certainly, no simple answer could be provided for such a question. However, the paper attempts to provide a rather tantalizing response by reflecting on some of the challenges faced by researchers based in African institutions of higher education, especially black researchers when trying to fulfill their mandate to conduct research and produce new knowledge. Using examples from different African contexts, the paper outlines a number of challenges these researchers have to contend with compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. This is very crucial if the current situation is to be remedied at all in future.

ID MATHEMATICS; CLASSROOM; LANGUAGE
AB According to Schafer (2005), the poor performance of South African learners in the 1995 and 1999 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is largely ascribed to the problem that learners and educators have in studying and teaching through English as a second or even third language.
   Second language learners who are already experiencing difficulty in understanding the English language may therefore be unable to develop skills to solve word problems since mathematics is being taught to them through the medium of English. This study investigates the language difficulties of second language mathematics learners, and how mathematics teachers can adapt their teaching strategies to teach word problems to second language learners.
   Word problems is a section in the grade 8 mathematics syllabus that is problematic for many second language learners. The language and reading skills needed to comprehend word problems and the listening skills required to understand the teacher's explanation of the solution are the means through which learners learn and apply mathematical concepts and skills. Many second language learners are able to solve mathematical problems when they are presented in numbers and equations but they experience difficulty in sorting and sifting out the important information when the same problem is written in words. Poor comprehension of the English language results in second language learners misunderstanding word problems.
   Research has been carried out to give teachers a working knowledge of teaching mathematics to second language learners, and the strategies and techniques to make teaching effective. There is however insufficient research on the difficulties experienced by second language mathematics learners in solving word problems. This study therefore investigates the impact of the language barrier in understanding word problems, and seeks to determine what teaching strategies may be employed by mathematics educators to help second language learners solve word problems.
   The theoretical framework that was used in this study is Piaget's constructivist learning theory. Constructivism can be traced back to the eighteenth century and the work of philosopher Giambattista Vico, who maintained that humans can understand only what they have constructed themselves. Solving word problems using the constructivist learning theory requires the learner to identify and evaluate problems, then to come up with ways in which to transfer their learning to these problems.

DE Research management; predictor output; research output; increase output
ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB Orientation
   Research management related activities are usually associated with measurable targets, detailed plans, rigorous evaluation and decisive action - all of which are observable (perhaps programmable) behaviours also referred to as tangible factors. Becker, Huselid and Ulrich [1] argue that the tangible factors of any successful institution can be copied, technology can be bought, and in theory you should have an instantly thriving research institution. It is, however, clear that although many institutions have exactly the same technology and structure as their successful competitors, they still fail to succeed in increasing research output. This raises the proposition that the intangible factors of an institution are what create success or failure. Intangibles are difficult to quantify, are based on people's assumptions, cannot be bought or imitated, and appreciate in value with purposeful use [2]. I propose that tangibles are seldom what create a thriving research university and that intangibles are the factors that create competitive advantage. I further propose that, for research management, intangible factors do not exist without tangible factors. Research management, of which impact is measured through research output, can only be optimized through a balanced combination of tangibles and intangibles.
   Research focus
   In this regard a study was conducted at two merged South African higher education institutions to determine which factors, as identified in a literature study as well as through a factor analysis of survey data, were predictive of the dependent variable 'research output'.
   Research design
   A survey, based on the theoretical model, was distributed to 411 academics across five campuses and yielded a 49.6% response rate. The analysis approaches utilised were Chi square tests, Cronbach alpha tests, Factor analysis, ANOVA, CHAID analysis, Regression analysis.
   Main findings and interpretations
   The empirical model that was derived through a factor analysis from this study strengthens the argument that both types of factors exist in a research environment. Furthermore, the tangible and intangible factors play a different role in predicting research output. The tangible factors are predictors of research output for non-research-active academics, which means that the research-active academics are motivated to produce research output by factors other than tangible factors.
   On the question "Which factors are predictors of research output?" The theoretical research output prediction model highlights the fact that factors associated directly with researchers, namely their 'professional activities' (83.46%) and 'individual skills and competence' (94.52%) are the predictors of research output. Apart from the institution's provision of opportunities for participation in professional activities or opportunities for the development of skills and competence, the theoretical model indicates that the factors that predict research output are up to an individual researcher and not institutional management. The very high prediction rate of 94.52% of 'individual skills and competence' indicates that staff development in research skills should be very high on a university's priority list when attempting to stimulate research output.

AB Over the years business researchers have been challenged in their quest to develop evaluation models and instruments to evaluate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) effectiveness. In the current era in which ICT4D (ICT for Development) has been firmly entrenched on the social and development agenda, researchers have been confronted with the same challenge This paper reports on the design of an investigation for the evaluation of sock) economic outcomes of a national programme of community-based telecentres The paper describes the challenges that were encountered in developing a suitable design frame to conduct the study. In presenting the research design, we discuss the rationale, and motivations for various design decisions. Additionally the paper highlights the short sightedness of implementers of ICT4D projects in incorporating monitoring and evaluation strategies during the conceptualization and implementation of ICT interventions

AB The measurement of Information Systems (IS) effectiveness has been prominent on the research agenda since the 1980s. Consequently various approaches for measuring IS effectiveness have been produced including that of service quality. This approach has its roots in the marketing discipline where service quality is primarily used to measure business success via a customer satisfaction set of dimensions. With the advent of e-commerce., many studies have focused on online service quality measurement from the marketing perspective. There has been scant attention however, to the role of the IS function in achieving acceptable levels of online service quality In acknowledging the elevated role of the IS function in the e-commerce environment, the primary objective of this paper, is to highlight the issues around service quality, and in doing so shift this research agenda into the domain of IS management In light of this a review of both traditional and electronic service quality research is provided A comprehensive set of e-Service Quality dimensions are consequently synthesized and discussed Finally, the authors explore the implications of these dimensions for the IS function. The paper concludes by suggesting that an important contributor to IS success in the e-Commerce environment relates to the degree in which IS functionaries embrace Service Quality attributes in the planning, design, implementation and management of IS

AB The relationship between enterprise architecture and its service delivery process in an organizational context suggests an interesting view on the role of the enterprise architect. Literature reveals that many of the challenges that enterprise architects encounter, are largely non-technical in nature This points to the need for a non-technical perspective on the role of an enterprise architect in the overall enterprise architecting process but also in the social, organizational context. Interviews were conducted with enterprise architects in South Africa to understand the challenges currently facing them. This study explores the fundamental understanding of the role of the enterprise architect particularly in the South African organizational context which is characterized by complex cultural and other differences. It suggests that for any enterprise architect - but particularly in South Africa - should strongly consider the non-technical perspectives in order to effectively architect the enterprise.

DE learning difficulties; dyslexia; computer-based screening; diagnostic
   teaching
AB This paper describes the development of a computer-based error analysis procedure for identification of children with learning difficulties. The procedure is based on the use of profiles established through aggregative case survey analysis of seventeen small-scale studies conducted between 2001 and 2005, as well as two large-scale studies conducted over the same period which compared the types of spelling errors made by learners in different grades at primary school. These initial studies produced evidence of distinctive patterns of error made by both mainstream and remedial learners.
   Our subsequent studies have focused on the use of the tests and diagnostic procedures we have developed in classrooms and clinics. Based on statistical comparison of both frequencies and proportions of errors made by mainstream and remedial children, as well as regression and discriminant function analyses to establish the types of errors made by children, we have developed procedures for computer-based error analysis which can be applied in classrooms by teachers working with large groups. We have used error profiles for identification of children requiring special treatment programmes, based on the preponderance of particular types of spelling errors. The results of our studies suggest that patterns of written spelling error made by learners may be relevant indicators of learning difficulties in school, for the reason that the types of written spelling errors made by remedial learners are persistent as they progress through school.
   The type of information yielded by our procedures can also be used for planning remedial instruction which targets the specific types of errors made by individual children in the classroom, as well as for clinical use in planning individual instructional programmes. Computerised scoring and profile analysis carries with it the possibility that the procedures can be used on a large-scale. Our research indicates that the tests we have developed are both content and construct valid when measured against other commonly available scholastic tests of reading, writing and spelling, and in addition yield detailed diagnostic information on the types of spelling errors made by children. The tests we have developed are also reliable, and have good potential as group tests for use as screening instruments to identify children with dyslexia, tapping error patterns which are predictors of learning difficulties, and providing information relevant to diagnostic teaching.

DE Key academic performance indicators; performance measures; quality in
   higher education; critical success factors
AB This study attempted to formulate key academic performance indicators (KAPIs) for staff at Comprehensive Universities. Following an extensive literature survey and a quantitative and qualitative research design two questionnaires were developed and mailed to 243 academics and 12 members of Management. One hundred correctly completely questionnaires were received from academics and 11 from members of Management. Using a process of triangulation, the questionnaires were followed up by personal interviews with 11 members of Management to ensure the validity the reliability of the results. Key academic performance indicators were formulated for staff. However, respondents have a number of concerns in achieving these KAPIs. These concerns must be addressed if the KAPIs suggested for staff could be realised. A number of recommendations are made to achieve the KAPIs for staff at a Comprehensive University.

DE Mathematics curriculum; school and university curricula; matches and
   mismatches curriculum
AB There have been radical changes in the South African school curriculum. This paper presents an investigation into current matches and mismatches in mathematics curriculum content at further education and training (FET) schools and teacher training institutions. New Mathematics curriculum content in FET schools poses a challenge that teacher training institutions have to restructure their Mathematics curricula to suit school-based ones. The pace at which these changes occur seems not to be coordinated between the FET and Higher Education (HE) sectors. Significant changes relate to mathematical knowledge and pedagogy. Changes in one of the sectors force the other to recurriculate. The study compares and contrasts current curriculum content from each of the two sectors.

DE Mentoring; e-Mentoring; virtual mentoring; TAMP
AB Tools such as the World Wide Web (WWW) and other computer-related utilities (e. g. the TAMP website) would be useful in further enhancing the process of mentorship, bridging the gap between skilled, experienced, knowledgeable individuals, and those who can benefit from these collective qualities when shared. Mentorship has the special ability to give participants the opportunity to share knowledge, develop skills, and to grow. This paper will share a story of using a website to conduct a mentorship programme called the Technical Application Mentorship Programme (TAMP) for the learners in the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT).
   TAMP mentors are trained senior learners, who assist junior learners (mentees) with computer programming languages like COBOL, C++, JAVA, and VB. NET. The use of technology gives the programme the advantage of having a self-service setting, with mentees being able to login, diarise mentorship sessions, provide feedback, and also to plan their activities effectively. The paper will demonstrate how technology, more especially WWW tools, can help in implementing educational programmes aimed at improving each mentee's performance and promoting e-Mentoring.
   e-Mentoring, or virtual mentoring, can be explained as a process where a mentee and a mentor communicate via the web in order to solve certain problems. Based on TAMP's website experience, the paper will further caution on the functionality that should be avoided when developing such mentorship WWW tools, and over and above the disadvantages of using these kinds of tools.

DE Engineering education; health; social and economical issues
AB The South African women working in the engineering field face a harsh reality. In spite of politically correct policies and increasing campaigns that are championed by the South African Government for the women promotion and protection, progress is very slow. Men from all racial groups and social backgrounds, although very divided along economical and racial lines, miraculously do agree that engineering is not a suitable career path for women. In the past the South African white women were employed mainly in secretarial, administrative, nursing, primary and high education sectors. Until recently the white women were employed in the tertiary teaching system, had to use a separate, lateral entrance in order to access the working place. The career opportunities for the African and Coloured women, due to poverty and lack of education, were limited to that of domestic workers, office cleaners or house wives. Today career opportunities in engineering have been made available to women as many of the big corporations specifically target women from the previously disadvantaged communities for schooling and employment. However old habits die hard and there is a strong undercurrent of discrimination against female engineers in the working place. Women protection and promotion policies are fundamental toward attaining real freedom and empowerment. In spite of the Constitutional protection that the women enjoy, our extremely patriarchal society has a problem tolerating women in the engineering field. This study tries to understand the reasons behind the male engineers' attitude and suggest some strategies forward.

DE Engineering education; health; social and economical issues
AB The devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on the lives of young people is a matter of great concern for all primary and tertiary level educators in South Africa. It is difficult to provide quality education when educators are increasingly absent from their duties due to illness and learners are ill themselves or living in abject poverty as AIDS orphans. The terrible psychological toll of the AIDS related deaths in the families and communities where the teaching institutions are situated is difficult to estimate. There are many publicised opinions about the South African Government's stance on HIV/AIDS policies; however, the common denominator is that everybody agrees that the problem needs to be addressed. At a lower level it appears that all responsible institutions in our country are trying to develop a holistic approach to HIV/AIDS with lasting solutions. To better understand the HIV/AIDS impact on the lives of young people, a study was carried out on 315 Mechanical Engineering Technology students at the University of Johannesburg. Considering the generally accepted parameters, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) has a well organised programme to inform/educate students and staff alike, about the dangers and possible treatment of HIV/AIDS infection and opportunistic diseases. Since a staggering 80% of the surveyed students are not happy with the UJ HIV/AIDS awareness program, this study shows that the program is not reaching its intended target and a new approach is needed. The study found that there is strong discrimination against people infected with HIV/AIDS, that young people fear disclosing their HIV/AIDS status, and that there is a high degree of reality denial which is reflected by the refusal of young people to have themselves tested even if nearly 80% of the students surveyed know somebody who has died of HIV/AIDS personally.

DE Women in engineering; women in built environment; technology; success
   criteria; program development framework
AB The attraction, education and retention of women in engineering and the built environment are paramount to the socio-economic development of South Africa. The Center for Research on Science, Engineering and Technology found that women represent fifty two percent of the African population, estimated at a total of 800 million. In South Africa, female students constitute fifty three percent of all higher education enrolments and fifty eight percent of first degree graduates. At postgraduate level, however, fewer than half of all enrolments and graduates are female. The number of female student doctoral enrolments and graduates are the lowest in the Natural Sciences and Engineering sectors. Women are under-represented in industry, and in academia women represent less than thirty percent of the workforce. The Women in Engineering and the Built Environment Program at the University of Johannesburg was launched in 2006 to address the shortage of women in engineering and the built environment. The program has three primary objectives namely, to build interest and attract women students to study in the field, to provide a support and development network for professional and academic women, and to supply industry with an increased number of female engineering and technology graduates. The program is considered a key community engagement project of the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment and, since its inception, the number of registered female students has increased by two hundred and twenty seven. This paper provides an overview of the strategic focus of the program, and discusses its developments to date, as compared with seven other Women in Engineering Programs. The authors discuss the future of the program, provide a framework to understand and compare Women in SET Programs and conclude with thoughts on success measures.

AB This paper presents a non-experimental, exploratory and descriptive study of Engineering Drawing N2 students from four Ekurhuleni West College (EWC) campuses in order to learn more about factors that possibly contribute to the lack of success in Engineering Drawing N2 of EWC in 2003. The poor academic performance of students in Drawing N2 at EWC Kempton campus became a concern and had to be addressed. The number of students at EWC Kempton campus doing Drawing N2 used to between 50 and 60 per trimester. Some of the students started being reluctant to take Drawing N2 since May 2003. The number of Drawing N2 students dropped to between 40 and 50 students per trimester (as from the second trimester of 2003) and so were the academic performance. The methodology used in this study included data collected through structured interviews, questionnaires, classroom observations and the use of previous Drawing N2 results form Kempton campus and the National level.
   The following categories of factors were identified to be the contributing factors to poor academic performance of Drawing N2 students in EWC in 2003: lack of knowledge in the importance of Drawing N2, unsuitable Drawing N2 classrooms, insufficient exam time for Drawing, expensive Drawing instruments, lack of instruments amongst students, lack of Drawing models and lack of Drawing background to N2 level.

DE Multilingualism; Academic literacy; Second language; Higher education
AB South Africa is a multilingual country with eleven official languages and at least thirteen non-official indigenous and foreign languages. It is also a country marred by a history of legislated segregation and inequality in the socioeconomic arena and education policy. The current education policy in South Africa aims for equal access by all South Africans to the country's resources. By extension, the National government aims to provide equal, quality education to all South Africans at the school level so as to prepare them for optimal participation and success in life and higher education. Unfortunately it is not always the case that every South African learner receives an education that equips him/her to participate fully and actively in higher education, and lifelong learning, as envisaged by the National government. It is mostly black public school educated learners who, due to poor quality human and physical resources at their schools, struggle with their studies at tertiary institutions. These learners generally arrive at institutions of higher learning with a basic knowledge of the English language and low levels of academic literacy. Their low proficiency in English and low academic literacy levels, coupled with the challenge that any student has in acquiring the knowledge associated with his field of learning, make it necessary for these students to be supported in terms of academic literacy in order to facilitate success in their education and skills development. This paper is meant to propose a comprehensive academic literacy support initiative to address the recurring problem of poor academic literacy amongst black second language speakers of English at the University of the Free State (Qwaqwa campus). Acquisition planning in higher education should include a comprehensive academic literacy support initiative addressing students' Language (grammar), Logic (Argumentation and skills in analysis), Learning styles (inductive, active learning as opposed to deductive, passive learning) and Literacy (Traditional: reading and writing skills; and Quantitative: mathematical literacy for academia). It should be planned and implemented with consideration of the cultural specificity of African students' schematic composition which might interfere with their ability to make sense of, initially or throughout the entire period of study, many concepts in their area(s) of study in the West dominated higher education context.

DE educational performance; problem solving; mathematics; science; chess;
   competition
AB For some years now, in South Africa, a major thrust has been underway to improve educational performance at all levels.
   This thrust has been met with some noticeable improvements. However, the technical subjects of mathematics, science and other technological subjects still remain a major impediment to general progress, for a large sector of the population.
   A logical problem solving framework has to be imparted to many learners to give them the foundation on which to build mathematics and science ability.
   One way in which this is being addressed is to introduce chess into primary and senior schools. An experimental chess program has been introduced at the level of Grade One. This program is delivering good results. It has been introduced together with a train-the-trainer program.
   A second school program has been introduced for learners in the 10 to 16 year age bracket. A target of this program is to provide the learners with inter-school league competition opportunities, the idea being that they view the playing of chess as a fun competitive exercise, rather than as an exercise for the mathematics class.

AB South Africa's organizations are influenced in one way or the other, by unionized labour which tends to govern their business activities and thus accelerate labour disputes that lead to industrial action. Since numerous disputes centre in interests and not in rights, industrial action can and does occur. Sometimes it may occur before procedures are utilized and at others after the procedures have been exhausted.
   There are various reports on the number of strikes that took place in the motor manufacturing industry. These included the following: About 49 000 workers in the motor components industry that went on strike on September 12 2007 over wages. The Retail Motor Industry (RMI) offered a raise of between 8,5% and 10% based on workers' grading. National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) was demanding a 9% increase, and a minimum wage of R2 000 a month or R509 a week.
   All these strike actions led to several motor-manufacturing plants in the country closing doors temporarily as parts became unavailable. These plants included Volkswagen General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Nissan and Toyota (Mail & Guardian, 2007: 20and Business Report, 2007: 2). Another Numsa industrial action took place in September 18 2009 whereby Volkswagen lost about 500 cars per day (Mail & Guardian, 2009: 25).
   The aim of the empirical study is to get an insight of the reasons behind industrial action in this sector. Furthermore it will highlight the effects of industrial action on the productivity of the firm as well as its impact on the employees, the Government as well as the community at large, technologically, politically, legally, socially, economically. Moreover a strategic model to solve the problem will be developed.

AB A role model for entrepreneurial firms in a global business environment is developed and presented with a view to addressing the entrepreneurial roles (what tasks are performed) that a firm has to fulfil in a specific way. This is done via a survey of the relevant literature on intrapreneurship in a global context where high technology plays an important role. The role model can be interpreted as a synthesis between the individualistic and the collectivistic approaches of intrapreneurship found in the literature. It captures several roles of intrapreneurship as identified in the respective work of various authors within an integrative and holistic framework.

AB The CCQM-P106 pilot study was organized by the inorganic working group of the Comit, Consultatif pour la Quantit, de MatiSre (CCQM) as a feasibility comparison to study the applicability of different analysis methods to the polypropylene sample and test the abilities of the participants for measuring the Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb in polypropylene. National Institute of Metrology P.R. China (NIM) acted as the coordinating laboratory of this pilot study. There were 21 laboratories that submitted the final results. The median values of the mass fraction of Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb were 36.12 mg kg(-1) (the median absolute deviation about the median (MADe) = 0.46 mg kg(-1)), 252.5 mg kg(-1) (MADe = 3.4 mg kg(-1)), 387.0 mg kg(-1) (MADe = 10.1 mg kg(-1)) and 466.2 mg kg(-1) (MADe = 8.9 mg kg(-1)), respectively. Isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement methods were used, and microwave digestion was used by the most of the participants. In general, very good agreement of the results was observed. Moreover, compared to the results of other methods, the results of IDMS still showed less spread amongst laboratories and had a smaller uncertainty. In addition, the results of some analytes used by XRF and INAA also got satisfactory agreement with the median value.

AB We have observed MRC 1925-296 using the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 618 MHz. We classify MRC 1925-296 as a Wide Angle Tail (WAT) source with a rather asymmetric morphology in extent with respect to the radio core. The host galaxy of MRC 1925-296 is coincident with an E+4 galaxy (ESO460-004) of r magnitude 13.83, with a redshift of 0.02442. Using multi-wavelength data, we derive physical properties of the source.

AB The management of IT involves the thoughtful consideration of the management of stakeholders' knowledge as information system success depends upon synergy between human and technical systems. In this paper particular attention is paid to the notion of frames, or frames of reference, held by the stakeholders of information systems and their effects on system adoption and use. A qualitative study is performed in the context of an engineering firm's adoption of a commercial ERP package. Findings suggest that besides frames of technology, the beliefs and perceptions that stakeholders have of each other influence their utilization of technological artifacts and influence the operation of information systems.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of simple sequence repeats as genetic markers in five species of the Solanum nigrum complex found in South Africa as well as their progeny. Some of the primers developed for sorghum, tomato, pepper and potato were used. Twenty-nine random sets of primers were selected for screening and seven were used to amplify each of the parents and their progeny. The optimum conditions were not the same for the various primer pairs with annealing temperatures of 45, 50 and 55 degrees C for different primers. The genetic-distance value amongst the species and their progeny varied from 0.33 to 0.55, showing the close relationship between entries and confirming the fact that the Solanum nigrum complex is a group of plants very closely related, yet the parents and their progeny could be clearly distinguished. This marker system therefore was very effective in distinguishing closely related accessions arising from a similar pedigree and could be used for molecular breeding in this species.

AB The timing of early reproductive events for the Natal long-fingered bat, Miniopterus natalensis, was examined during its breeding season (August to December) in its maternity roost at the De Hoop Nature Reserve (South Africa) This migrating species is monoestrous with copulation occurring around April in South African populations. Embryonic development is stalled during hibernation by delayed implantation of the blastocyst As a result, limb bud stage embryos (CS 13) are first noted in other South African populations in mid-September The timing of these reproductive events for the Dc Hoop population is similar with bats arriving at the maternity roosts in September and embryos at the limb bud stage (CS 13) being noted in this month. Pregnancy was not synchronous in the population with bats dissected on the same day exhibiting differences in the stage of development of their young (CS11 to CS21 being the largest range) Maternal features (progesterone concentration, body mass and abdominal distension) were analysed to determine if they provided a reliable estimate of embryonic stage The progesterone concentrations of pregnant bats showed a similar profile to the Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape populations Though progesterone concentration did increase as pregnancy progressed, it was not an accurate predictor of embryonic stage Maternal body mass did not correlate with the stage of embryonic development However, abdominal distension determined by palpation is an accurate field based predictor of the stages of pregnancy no abdominal distension, small to medium abdominal distension and large abdominal distension distinguished between non-pregnant bats and those carrying either early (CS11-CS15) or mid-developmental stages (CS16-CS21), respectively

AB The bat fauna of Mozambique is poorly documented. We conducted a series of inventories across the country between 2005 and 2009, resulting in the identification of 50 species from 41 sites. Of these, seven species represent new national records that increase the country total to 67 species. These data include results from the first detailed surveys across northern Mozambique, over an area representing almost 50% of the country. We detail information on new distribution records and measurements of these specimens. Special attention is paid to the Rhinolophidae, because these include several taxa that are currently in a state of taxonomic confusion. Furthermore, we also present some notes on taxonomy, ecology and echolocation calls. Finally, we combine modelled distributions to present predicted species richness across the country. Species richness was lowest across the coastal plain, to the east and far north, and is predicted to increase in association with rising altitude and higher topographic unevenness of the landscape.

AB The Pt(II) atom in the title compound, [PtCl2(C27H27NP2)], has a highly distorted square-planar geometry, as evidenced by the P-Pt-P bite angle [72.4 (1)degrees]. The strain in the complex is further illustrated by the distorted tetrahedral angles of the P atoms, which range between 93.5 (1) and 122.2 (1)degrees. It is of interest to note that the N atom has to adopt an almost planar geometry with the two P atoms and the C atom attached to it [it is displaced by 0.093 (2) angstrom from the CP2 plane] in order to accommodate the steric bulk of the phenyl groups and the alkyl group of the ligand coordinated to the Pt-II centre. The molecules pack in horizontal rows across the bc plane. C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl hydrogen bonds stabilize the crystal packing.

AB This report provides in vivo evidence of adult neurogenesis and the total granule cell count in the dentate gyrus of the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Mice were deeply anaesthetised and perfused with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same fixative overnight. Following equilibration in 30% sucrose, 30 mu m sections were cut in sagittal plane in freezing microtome for immunohistochemistry and 20 mu m from plastic embedded brains. Thioflavin-S confirmed the presence of amyloid plaques in the Tg2576 mice. Cell proliferation in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of hippocampus were observed with Ki-67 and doublecortin markers. Using optical fractionator, total granule number was estimated to be 445,280 per hemisphere in the 18-month-old Tg2576 mouse. Cell proliferation tends to end in the dentate gyrus but continues in the SVZ and the total granule cell number was less compared to normal laboratory and wild rodents.

AB Mantoscyphidians occur in high numbers on the gills of South African Haliotis and limpet species. This provided the ideal opportunity to study asexual and sexual reproduction, for the first time in different African Mantoscyphidia Jankowski, 1985 populations. Descriptions of the reproductive processes found in scyphidiid peritrichs were until now, mostly based on line drawings. Scanning electron- and light microscopy contributed uniquely, in providing detail information regarding binary fission, telotroch formation and conjugation. Mantoscyphidia spadiceae Botes, Basson and Van As, 2001 shed the most light on binary fission. Micronuclear division occurred first with the plane of fission already evident and macronuclear cleavage ended just before final separation took place. Fission is not complete until a small string of pellicle that joins the daughter cells finally separates. Information on telotroch development was gathered from M. branchi Van As, Basson and Van As, 1998 and M. spadiceae populations. Telotrochs were between 36.7 and 38.6% shorter than live, extended man-toscyphidians and their swimming action resembled mobiline peritrichs. Mantoscyphidia branchi populations also proved to be most useful for conjugation studies. Conjugation included three progamic nuclear divisions and preceded synkaryon formation and two metagamic nuclear divisions. The process required 24 hours to be completed.

AB During parasitological surveys in Tasmania (Australia), four introduced fish species were investigated for the presence of trichodinid ectoparasites. Five trichodinid species were found on the skin, fins and gills of two of these fishes, i.e. the tench Tinca tinca Linnaeus, 1758 and the red fin perch Perca fluviatillis Linnaeus, 1758. Four trichodinids are known species for which comparative descriptions are provided, i.e. Trichodina acuta Lom, 1961, T. esocis Lom, 1961, T. lepsii Lom, 1962 and Trichodinella epizootica (Raabe 1950) Sramek-Husek, 1953. A fifth species, i.e. Trichodina tunnae sp. n. is described as a new species from the red fin perch. All species are described using silver impregnated and hematoxylin stained specimens.

DE Lissajous Pattern; Ultrasonic Motor
AB We investigate a novel ultrasonic rotary motor which generates a stator trajectory in the form of a figure-of-eight by superimposing two resonant modes, with one double the frequency of the other. Topology optimization was used to design the stator structure. In contrast to traditional travelling wave ultrasonic motors, which require two modes to be driven 90 degrees out of phase, only one amplifier is required to drive the proposed device. A prototype device was characterised experimentally and was used to drive a rotary ball bearing at 12 RPM reversibly in an open loop.

AB A piezoelectric inchworm motor is developed for battery powered unmanned aerial vehicles where energy efficiency is critical. The motor comprises two stationary clamps and a moving extender, which uses two piezoelectric stack actuators in push-pull mode with a displacement amplification mechanism. A switching converter is used to provide the voltage supply, and switching amplifiers are used to drive the piezoelectric stacks. These were designed for efficiency, weight and reliability.

AB Wireless sensor networks allow unprecedented abilities to observe and understand large-scale, real-world phenomena at a fine spatial-temporal resolution. Their application in Developing Countries is even more interesting: they can help solve problems that affect communities. One of the limitations of current wireless sensors is the communication range, with most devices having 100 meters as maximum range. In contrast, many applications require long-range wireless sensor network where nodes are separated by large distances, giving the advantage of being able to monitor a large geographic area. In this paper we will present the results of an integrated approach combining a planning step using simulations and an experimental step carried out using off-the-shelf equipment over distances ranging from 600m to 12km. The results reveal that the simulation results agree with experimentation and show that long distance wireless sensor networks (LDWSN) are possible and that the quality of these links is high. Finally, we discuss the relative efficiency of our solution in terms of range compared to other wireless sensor networks.

DE Contention; Control Channel; Channel Switching; Channel Utilization;

AB In Multi-channel systems control packets handshake reserves both control and data channels where a dedicated control channel is implemented. RTS and CTS packets should sense the medium and agree on a specific data channel. The process is long and it wastes resources when there is no agreement. We propose an RTS based channel reservation and access scheme. The CTS agrees with RTS to reserve a specific data channel without sensing the medium to reduce reservation delay. Data channel reservation is done when a data channel is available. The paper first presents a scalable channel switching scheme. Numeric results show that the channel switching scheme is efficient and scalable. Furthermore, the simulation results show that when the utilization of data channels is restricted to seventy-five percent, the RTS based scheme performs better. The seventy-five percent threshold is when the data flows constitute three quarters of the number of the data channels.

AB In this paper, we present a technique for a network error correcting code using Random Network Coding. We introduce a novel error correction scheme that uses the implicit encoding capability of Random Network Coding. This scheme does not add redundancy to the data prior to transmission, but ads redundancy based on information already contained in the network. Random Network Coding within a large network generates enough redundant information to perform error correction on transmitted data.

DE Elasto-plastic; frames; axial forces; ultimate load; plastic hinge;
   mechanism
AB A numerical model for first order elasto-plastic limit analysis of structural plane frame subjected to combined bending moment and axial force actions is presented. The model takes into account the influence of axial forces on the ultimate load carrying capacity of the structure. It also allows for reversal of plastic hinge formation.
   The applicability, of the model has been demonstrated through elastic-plastic analysis of rectangular frames. The numerical solutions of the frames are compared to those obtained in the traditional simple elasto-plastic analysis which neglects the effects of axial forces on the ultimate load carrying capacity of the structure.
   The numerical solutions obtained in the frame showed that when the amount of axial force in the elements of a frame exceed 15% of the respective element plastic axial force, the conventional first order elasto-plastic limit analysis method over estimates the load carrying capacity of structures, grossly mispredicts the bending moment distributions and moment-normal force interaction behaviour of the structure at fully plastic stage and gives results which violate the plastic condition of the fundamental conditions of simple plastic theory. Further, the new technique increased the rate of structure stiffness degradation and altered the number, location and sequence of formation of plastic hinges and the type of collapse mechanism mode when axial forces were large.

AB The present paper focuses on smoothing techniques for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) satellite images. Due to the non-uniformity of the noise in the image as well as their relatively low spatial resolution, automatic analysis on SST images usually gives poor results. This paper presents a new framework to smooth and enhance the information contained in the images. The gray levels in the image are filtered using a mesh smoothing technique called SOWA while a new technique for resolution enhancement, named grid smoothing, is introduced and applied to the SST images. Both techniques (SOWA and grid smoothing) represent an image using an oriented graph. In this framework, a quadratic criterion is defined according to the gray levels (SOWA) and the spatial coordinates of each pixel (grid smoothing) and minimised using non-linear programming. The two-steps enhancement method is tested on real SST images originated from Meteosat first generation satellite.

AB Humans lack the enzymes needed to metabolize endogenous and dietary oxalate. a toxic compound causing hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Oxalate in humans can be eliminated through (1) excretion in urine, (2) forming insoluble calcium oxalate and elimination in feces, or (3) oxalate degradation by gastrointestinal (GIT) microorganisms. In this article, anaerobic oxalate catabolism in gut bacteria is reviewed, and the possible use of these bacteria as probiotics for treating kidney stone disease is evaluated. Oxalobacter formigenes and Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are the best studied in this regard, with oxalate degradation in the lactic acid bacteria being both species- and strain-specific. The GIT oxalate-degrading bacteria express the catabolic enzymes formyl-CoA transferase (Frc) and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (Oxc). The genes encoding these proteins are clustered on the genomes and show strong phylogenetic relationships. Clinical trials investigating reduced hyperoxaluria through administering O. formigenes or its enzymes show a promising trend, but the data need confirmation through larger scale, well-controlled trials. Similar studies using Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species also show in vivo oxalate reduction, but these data are still controversial. In particular, further investigations need to determine whether there is a direct link between the lack of oxalate-degrading bacteria and hyperoxaluria and whether their absence is a risk factor. Key experiments linking microbial numbers, functional oxalate degradation, molecular analysis of the regulation of the genes involved, and the ability of the bacteria to survive in the gut are crucial elements in identifying suitable probiotics for treating kidney stone disease.

DT Review
AB This paper gives an overview of the attempts to determine the distribution of dark matter in low surface brightness disk and gas-rich dwarf galaxies, both through observations and computer simulations. Observations seem to indicate an approximately constant dark matter density in the inner parts of galaxies, while cosmological computer simulations indicate a steep power-law-like behaviour. This difference has become known as the "core/cusp problem," and it remains one of the unsolved problems in small-scale cosmology.

AB The Watcher robotic telescope was developed primarily to perform rapid optical follow-up observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Secondary scientific goals include blazar monitoring and variable star studies. An automated photometry pipeline to rapidly analyse data from Watcher has been implemented. Details of the procedures to get image zero-point, source instrumental measurement, and limiting magnitude are presented. Sources of uncertainty are assessed and the performance of the pipeline is tested by comparison with a number of catalogue sources.

AB The use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) as an "everyday" concrete in the Ready-Mixed Concrete Industry is still limited and focused on certain specific applications. The introduction of Smart Dynamic Construction, an innovative technology able to provide the benefits of the traditionally vibrated concrete along with those of SCC including ease of production with enough robustness for everyday use in a cost-effective way, can contribute to expand the use of SCC in the Ready Mixed Industry.
   In the present paper, some practical experiences performed in Ready-Mixed Concrete plants are shown. The results shown that the production of Smart Dynamic Concrete using fines lower than 380 kg/m(3) is feasible by means of an innovative Viscosity Modifying Admixture called RheoMATRIX(C).

ID FRACTURE
AB In concrete road pavement design, the flexural strength of the material is used as a design parameter to predict fatigue life. Flexural strength however, is not a true material property as it varies with specimen size. Flexural strength also does not capture the full fracture toughness of the material, as it is an indicator of ultimate strength only. Especially for more ductile high performance fibre reinforced concrete it is appropriate to use fracture mechanics parameters to describe fracture toughness. The first objective of this paper is to quantify the size-effect for a high performance concrete, which was developed for use in an innovative pavement system. To investigate to which extent size-effect can be predicted through numerical simulation using fracture mechanics is the second objective of this paper. The results show the material to be subject to significant size effect in bending. The size-effect observed in the experiment can be satisfactorily predicted thorough numerical modelling with the embedded discontinuity method used for the study.

ID EPSILON-DESIGN METHOD
AB Modern admixtures make it possible to manufacture high performance concrete with compressive strengths in the region of 100 MPa. It should thus theoretically be possible to reduce the required size of elements in a concrete structure. Researchers have also proven that steel fibres can be used to increase the tensile and shear strength of concrete. For example it is possible to reduce the stirrups required as shear reinforcing in structures when using fibre reinforced concrete. Design engineers however, are reluctant to use fibre reinforcing to replace shear stirrups as the structural design codes used in most countries do not make provision for the use of fibres to increase the shear resistance of concrete elements. In this paper, experimental results will be given to show that significant material saving is possible, through the use of high strength fibre reinforced concrete.

AB High Performance Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) are characterized by a stress-strain response in tension that exhibits strain-hardening behaviour accompanied by propagation of multiple cracks. This process is often referred to as pseudo-ductility due to multiple cracking with relatively large energy absorption capacity. This study analyses the multiple cracking patterns formed in weathered Textile Concrete samples due to direct tensile testing, and links the cracking patterns to the tensile behaviour. The specimens used for the study were thin laminates which were produced by casting six layers of specially made polypropylene textile in fine-grained mortar. The samples were cured under controlled laboratory conditions for 28 days, and thereafter exposed to different weathering regimes for different periods. The weathered samples were tested in direct tension over a range of stresses. For all the samples tested, it was observed that the tensile behaviour was characterised by strain hardening and multiple cracking, which gave high tensile strains in excess of 20 percent at final failure. It was further found that the cracking patterns varied mainly with age, weathering history and stress levels. A general trend of increasing crack widths and crack spacings with ageing was observed which was accredited to increased hydration accompanied by an increase in fibre/matrix bond strength.

AB Synthetic microfibers have recently been introduced into the market. Such fibers can enhance properties of hardened concrete. As an example, shear strength and ductility of the material can be improved.
   An especially interesting application is shotcrete tunneling because it has requirements on ductility. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of synthetic macro fibers on flexural strength and post peak behavior based on a typical shotcrete mix design.
   Three different fibers have been selected for an experimental study. The tested fibers have 50 mm lengths and differ by their shape and surface morphology. All the selected fibers are tested at dosages of 3, 5 and 7 kg/m(3).
   This study was performed in order to clearly establish the benefits of such type of fibers on shotcrete mix design. This study aims to determine the influence of the fiber's different nature and respective dosage on:
   rheological behavior at fresh state; effect on superplasticizer dosage requirement at constant workability measured by slump test.
   28 days compressive and flexural strength.
   flexural post peak behavior in order to evaluate toughness enhancement.

AB Advantages associated with self compacting concrete (SCC) commonly relate to improved productivity on site, a better working environment, and enhanced homogeneity of the mix. The original objective of developing SCC was to increase the durability of concrete structures by making the concrete less susceptible to poor workmanship during placement and compaction. Given that SCC is a relatively new material, practical experience and research results on durability characteristics of SCC are still limited. Differences in pore structure and paste content between SCC and conventional vibrated concrete suggest that different transport characteristics may exist for aggressive agents such as carbon dioxide or chlorides. Research on durability reported in the literature however indicates that the durability characteristics of SCC are similar to those of vibrated concrete produced with the same binder type and water/binder ratio. Contradictory opinions still exist about whether or not common early age durability prediction test, which were developed and calibrated for conventional concrete, can equally be applied to SCC.
   This research aimed at identifying if the South African Durability Index approach is applicable for the prediction of the potential durability of SCC. Durability Index values of both SCC and conventional concrete samples were compared to accelerated carbonation and chloride diffusion characteristics. The test results indicate that similar durability characteristics exist for SCC and vibrated concrete and that the relationship between DI values and carbonation or chloride ingress are comparable.

AB The formation of multiple cracks under tensile load is believed to be a durability enhancing mechanism in strain-hardening cement composites (SHCC). The mechanism associated with multiple crack formation is control of individual cracks to widths in the micro-range, whereby new cracks form at close spacing, rather than old cracks widening. This is achieved by effective fibre bridging of the matrix cracks, enabling resistance to higher tensile loads without significant crack widening. To link the cracking characteristics of SHCC to durability, it is required to study crack formation and widening under various loading regimes, and relate them to physical and chemical processes of degradation. In this endeavour it is useful to find elegant ways to observe and characterise crack patterns, considering the high cracking densities, or small spacing of cracks at roughly 1-10 mm, combined with the complexities of crack tortuousity, branching and coalescence. In this paper crack observation with an ARAMIS non-contact, optical, 3D digital deformation observation device is reported. The system combines microscopy and digital image photography with speckle pattern recognition software, whereby local deformations can be computed with high resolution. For the results reported here, an observation area of 70 mm x 30 mm on a tensile specimen was used, whereby up to 60-70 cracks could be observed simultaneously. Crack patterns determined in this manner are reported for loaded and unloaded states. The methodology is used here to study the influence of cyclic loading and loading rate on crack width in SHCC.

ID RATE DEPENDENCE; BEHAVIOR
AB Strain-Hardening Cement Composites (SHCC) are designed to combine crack control and robust mechanical resistance in a durable construction material. Constitutive models that capture the dominating mechanisms of mechanical and time-dependent behaviour of this class of construction materials are essential for accurate structural analysis. Such models may be complex in order to capture the complex behaviour of fibre-reinforced cement-based construction materials. However, the value of such models lies in the ability it affords the specialist to predict structural behaviour beyond that measured in physical experiments, which is a cost-effective extension of physical experimental data. With the aid of such complex models, thorough understanding and eventual simpler analytical models can be derived. This paper describes a constitutive model for fibre-reinforced strain-hardening cement composites. In the derivation of the failure criteria and their dependence on strain hardening/softening, reference is made to results of characterising tests, including uniaxial tension and compression tests, shear tests, rate tests, as well as creep loads. The model is based on multi-surface, anisotropic, rate-dependent, computational continuum plasticity. Verification of the model is presented by analysis of two series of laboratory tests, namely SHCC and steel bar reinforced SHCC tested in flexure, and SHCC specimens tested in shear.

ID BEHAVIOR; ECC
AB Conventional concrete suffers in most cases from insufficient tensile strength and ductility. Strain Hardening Cement-based Composite is a type of High Performance Concrete (HPC) that was engineered to overcome these weaknesses. In comparison to conventionally reinforced concrete, SHCC demonstrates fine, multiple cracking under tensile loading which can be seen as a noticeable advantage from a durability point of view. The primary objective of the presented research is to develop a constitutive model that can be used to simulate structural components with SHCC under different types of loading. In particular, the constitutive model must be efficient and robust for large-scale simulations while restricted number of material parameters is needed. For the modelling of specific behaviour in tension, the application of classical material models used for quasi-brittle materials is not straightforward. The proposed numerical model is based on a rotating crack assumption to capture specific characteristics of SHCC, i. e. the strain hardening and softening, the multiple cracking and the crack localization. The multiple orthogonal crack patterns are allowed which is in accordance with the observations presented in Suryanto et al. (2008). The accuracy of the developed model is investigated by the comparison of the numerical results with experimental data.

AB Due consideration to account for the presence of concrete-steel plate interfaces should be given in the analysis and design of structures in which high performance concrete (HPC)-steel plate composite construction is adopted for main structural members, for connections between different members, and for providing different means to facilitate attachment of components on the body of the structure. Such a situation has been typically existed in the primary reactor containment dome of the present generation Indian Nuclear Power Plant Reactor Building. Typically, such primary reactor containment domes are built as post-tensioned prestressed concrete structures using HPC. The steel embedded parts which are made up of steel liner plates, and located along the edges of the steam generator openings in the dome, facilitate attachment of the dished head type steel sealing arrangement. HPC is normally used for such a construction in order to take of the situations arising out of the pre-stressing and other associated details for anchorages and the steel embedded plates at the openings. The issues related to the possible separation that may occur at the concrete-steel plate interfaces, are important in respect of leakages in the event of such separation. The present paper deals with some pertinent observation on the behaviour of HPC-steel plate interface based on the findings of a three-dimensional finite-element study of interface specimens using relevant experimental data.

AB The construction industry can reduce the volume of material required for a given structure by using High Performance Concrete (HPC) efficiently. It is a well established fact that an increase in the compressive strength of concrete results in a more brittle failure, which could result in sudden, catastrophic failure under unexpected loads or dynamic forces. Unexpected brittle failure can be prevented by the addition of suitable fibre reinforcing, resulting in High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC). Although researchers have successfully manufactured HPFRC in laboratory conditions for years, the implementation of this material on a large scale has been limited by both the lack of standard design procedures and standard material testing methods. This paper focuses on test methods and experimental results will be used to justify the need for developing test methods that will yield results that can be used in the design of HPFRC structures.

AB Principles of structural reliability are used mainly to provide a rational basis for improving the safety and economy of design practice with an extensive experience base. Execution of a development program for design procedures for innovative materials and applications on the basis of structural reliability ensures that the outcome readily conforms to existing practice. Other advantages are that reliability techniques could be applied to identify important sources of uncertainty on which subsequent testing and modelling investigations could focus. The use of Bayesian updating techniques allows optimal utilisation of existing information. This could compensate for the lack of an established experience base and extensive information. The development of a reliability based design model and procedure can highlight the advantages of the innovation. The objective of the paper is to outline the way in which the development of the application of an advanced concrete material such as SHCC should be approached.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Inter-node interference is an important performance metric in interworking multi-hop wireless networks. Such interference results from simultaneous transmissions by the nodes in these networks. Although several interference models exist in literature, these models are for specific wireless networks and MAC protocols. Due to the heterogeneity of link-level technologies in interworking multi-hop wireless networks, it is desirable to have generic models to evaluate interference on links in inter-working multi-hop wireless networks. This paper presents a generic model to provide information about the interference level on a link irrespective of the MAC protocol in use. The model determines the probability of interference and uses the negative second moment of the distance between a receiver-node and interfering-nodes to estimate the interference power on a link. Numerical results of the performance of the model are presented.

AB An aspect of kernel classifiers which complicates variable selection is the implicit use of the transformation function Phi. This function maps the space in which the data cases reside, the so-called input space (X), to a higher dimensional feature space (T). Variable selection in F is a difficult problem, while variable selection in X is mostly inadequate. We propose an intermediate kernel variable selection approach which is implemented in X while also accounting for the fact that kernel classifiers operate in F.

DE Classification; Discriminant analysis; Kernel methods
AB Kernel methods have become standard tools for solving classification and regression problems in statistics. An example of a kernel based classification method is Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA). Conceptually KFDA entails transforming the data in the input space to a high-dimensional feature space, followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) performed in feature space. Although the resulting classifier is linear in feature space, it corresponds to a non-linear classifier in input space. However, as in the case of LDA, the classification performance of KFDA deteriorates in the presence of influential data points. Louw et al. (Communications in Statistics: Simulation and Computation 37:2050-2062, 2008) proposed several criteria for identification of influential cases in KFDA. In extensive simulation studies these criteria have been found to be successful, in the sense that the error rate of the KFD classifier based on the data set after removal of influential cases, is lower than the error rate of the KFD classifier based on the entire data set. A disadvantage is that these criteria are calculated on a leave-one-out basis, which becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large data sets. In this paper we propose a two-step procedure for identifying influential cases in large data sets. Firstly, a subset of potentially influential data cases is found by constructing the smallest enclosing hypersphere (for each group) in feature space. Secondly, the proposed criteria are employed to identify influential cases, but only cases in the subset are considered on a leave-one-out basis, leading to a substantial reduction in computation time. We investigate the merit of this new proposal in a simulation study, and compare the results to the results obtained when not using the hypersphere as a first step. We conclude that the new proposal has merit.

AB This is an extension of the work done by Currie and Love (2010) where we studied the effect of applying two Crum-type transformations to a weighted second-order difference equation with non-eigenparameter-dependent boundary conditions at the end points. In particular, we now consider boundary conditions which depend affinely on the eigenparameter together with various combinations of Dirichlet and non-Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectra of the resulting transformed boundary value problems are then compared to the spectra of the original boundary value problems.

DE Wireless local area networks; digital forensic readiness
AB Over the past decade, wireless mobile communications technology based on IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) has been adopted worldwide on a massive scale. However, as the number of wireless users has soared, so has the possibility of cyber crime, where criminals deliberately and actively break into WLANs with the intent to cause harm or access sensitive information. WLAN digital forensics is seen not only as a response to cyber crime in wireless environments, but also as a means to stem the increase of cyber crime in WLANs. The challenge in WLAN digital forensics is to intercept and preserve all the communications generated by the mobile devices and conduct a proper digital forensic investigation. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing a wireless forensic readiness model designed to help monitor, log and preserve wireless network traffic for digital forensic investigations. A prototype implementation of the wireless forensic readiness model is presented as a proof of concept.

AB In this study the performances of some commercially available carbide inserts when machining Hastelloy C-22HS was investigated under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for wear mechanisms and other microstructure defects. Carbide inserts coated with TiCN/TiN and TiALN/TiN experienced severe intergranular fractures and cracks. High temperature causes the layer of the coating to wear off and subsequently the inserts damaged at fast rates. Both types of inserts suffered from high crater wear and thermal cracking. Most of the wear occurred at the nose and flank of the inserts. Generally, it was observed that carbide coated with TiALN/TiN cutting tool performed better than carbide coated TiCN/TiN cutting tool when milling Hastelloy C-22HS

AB Nature has often provided the inspiration needed for new computational paradigms and metaphors [1,16]. However natural systems do not exist in isolation and so it is only natural that hybrid approaches be explored. The article examines the interplay between three biologically inspired techniques derived from a plethora of natural phenomena. Cellular automata with their origins in crystalline lattice formation are coupled with the immune system derived clonal selection principle in order to regulate the convergence of the stochastic diffusion search algorithm. Stochastic diffusion search is itself biologically inspired in that it is an inherently multi-agent oriented search algorithm derived from the non-stigmergic tandem calling / running recruitment behaviour of ant species such as Temnothorax albipennis. The paper presents an invesitigation into the role cellular automata of differing complexity classes can play in order to establish a balancing mechanism between exploitation and exploration in the emergent behaviour of the system...

AB In this paper we investigate strongly prime ideals in the near-ring N(0)(R(n)) of continuous, zero-preserving self-maps of R(n). The strongly prime and uniformly strongly prime radicals of these near-rings are characterized. The Peano space-filling curves play a crucial role in this investigation. We also consider strongly prime ideals in N(0)(R(omega)), where omega denotes the first transfinite cardinal.

ID HOUGH-TRANSFORM; IMAGE
AB A novel straight line segment detection method is proposed in this paper, based on the theory of mapping straight line segment neighborhoods between the image and the HT spaces and the geometrical analysis of the HT butterfly wings. This paper makes full use of the information in the butterfly wings to detect the segments, i.e. detecting segments by matching its butterfly wings. Due to the fact that the butterfly changes its shape and orientation according to the segment parameters, this paper deduces an approximation of the butterfly wings with triangles by moving and/or flipping the segments to the position that minimizes the approximating error. This movement alleviates the computation and precision loss introduced by the butterfly distortions, because straight side triangular regions can be used to obtain the parameters of segments. Compared to existing methods that detect segments using HT data, the proposed method utilizes more information around the butterfly center, and hence is more effective, especially when it is used to detect collinear segments. The experiments verify the performance of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, implementation of an Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) and Myopic Unfalsified Control (MUC) algorithms into a microcontroller is investigated. First step taken was to search for a suitable hardware to accommodate these complex algorithms. The Motorola DSP56F807C and ARM7024 microcontrollers were selected for use in the research. The algorithms were coded in the C language of the respective microcontrollers and were tested by simulation of the DC Motor models obtained from step response of the motor.

AB The recent trend toward virtualized computing both as a means of server consolidation and as a powerful desktop computing tool has lead into a wide variety of studies into the performance of hypervisor products.
   This study has investigated the scalability of VMware Workstation 6 on the desktop platform. We present comparative performance results for the concurrent execution of a number of virtual machines. A through statistical analysis of the performance results highlights the performance trends of different numbers of concurrent virtual machines and concludes that VMware workstation can scale in certain contexts.
   We find that there are different performance benefits dependant on the application and that memory intensive applications perform less effectively than those applications which are 10 intensive. We also find that running concurrent virtual machines offers a significant performance decrease, but that the drop thereafter is less significant.

TI THE WORLD'S FIRST BIOMETRIC MONEY: GHANA'S E-ZWICH AND THE CONTEMPORARY
   INFLUENCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN BIOMETRICS

AB In January 2008 the Ghanaian Central Bank announced that it had introduced a new centralized mechanism for the settlement of transactions between the Ghanaian banks. This interbank switch, as it was called, was purchased from, and managed by, the South African company Net 1 UEPS, and it had a unique central organizing principle. The switch was indexed biometrically, using a key derived from the ten fingerprints of account holders. This new interbank switch and a smartcard encoded in the same way has equipped Ghana with the world's first biometric money supply. This article is an effort to explain the development and significance of this biometric money, which Ghanaians call the e-Zwich. It traces the way in which biometric registration in Ghana (as in other African countries) has leaked from the mundane, difficult, and mostly-unrewarding, task of civil registration into the more properly remunerated domain of monetary transactions. Viewed in the light of the rich historical anthropology of money in West Africa, what is at stake in Ghana may be much more significant than any of the current participants fully realize. Perhaps the most interesting finding of this study is that the e-Zwich system might actually succeed.

AB This paper demonstrates the extent to which the media and belonging in Africa are torn between competing and often conflicting claims of bounded and flexible ideas of culture and identity. It draws on studies of xenophobia in Cameroon and South Africa, inspired by the resilience of the politicization of culture and identity, to discuss the hierarchies and inequalities that underpin political, economic and social citizenship in Africa and the world over, and the role of the media in the production, enforcement and contestation of these hierarchies and inequalities. In any country with liberal democratic aspirations or pretensions, the media are expected to promote national citizenship and its emphasis on large-scale, assimilationist and territorially bounded belonging, while turning a blind eye to those who fall through the cracks as a result of racism and/or ethnicity. Little wonder that such an exclusionary articulation of citizenship is facing formidable challenges from its inherent contradictions and closures, and from an upsurge in the politics of recognition and representation by small-scale communities claiming autochthony at a historical juncture where the rhetoric espouses flexible mobility, postmodern flux and discontinuity.

AB According to most theorists of democratization, civil society is an important force in bringing about political change But does the advent of a democratic regime also affect the role of civil society during the consolidation of democracy? If so, what are the most relevant transformations? In order to address such research questions, this article analyses the case of South Africa and South Korea with a specific focus on how civil society has reshaped itself during the phase of democratic consolidation A particular emphasis is put on the changing relationship with the new democratic governments since the early 1990s until now The comparative analysis reveals common trends (e g risks of cooptation, changing forms of mobilization and new socio-political strategies), while it also singles out the most significant differences (e g. the constitution of a strong middle-class civil society in South Korea vis-a-vis the crisis and resurgence of civic activism across local communities in South Africa) against the backdrop of two rather different socioeconomic contexts

ID CHINESE
AB With the Chinese presence on the African continent being perceived and portrayed as a new global phenomenon there has been a concomitant, albeit sporadic and nuanced, emergence of an aversion to things Chinese, gradually permeating popular consciousness. In a post-colonial world these anti-Sinitic or Sino-phobic sentiments are crudely reminiscent of the late nineteenth century colonial cries of the "yellow peril", which culminated in acts of exclusion and extreme prohibition that singled out and targeted the Chinese in the various colonies across the Atlantic and Pacific including South Africa. This article, however, proposes to trace the genesis of some of anti-Sinicism to a pre-industrial period by considering developments in colonial Southern Africa. It will show how in the early Dutch settler and British colonial periods at the Cape, when the number of Chinese present in the region was miniscule, negative feelings towards the Chinese as the "other" were already apparent and evident in the reactions to them prior to the arrival of the large numbers which came to America, Australasia and Africa from the mid-nineteenth century onwards.

AB Contrary to media arguments that Chinese migration to Africa is part of a Chinese state project, the vast majority of new Chinese migrants in South Africa arrived (or made decisions to stay) independently, motivated by their desires to improve their lives. Newer Chinese migrants tend to follow paths cut by those who came earlier; some of these earlier migrants from the PRC came with Taiwanese businesses or state-owned enterprises. Today's Chinese migrants are quite diverse: they come from various parts of China, with different levels of education and experience, and from different class backgrounds. Migration processes and migration successes are linked to sending country, receiving country and global conditions; however, Chinese migrants themselves play an integral role in shaping perceptions, constructing new identities and changing spaces, giving substance to the idea of a "global south".

AB Twenty-three species of planktonic Foraminifera have been identified from surface sediments on the Thukela Shelf (KwaZulu-Natal Bight, South Africa). The assemblage is dominated by Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides ruber and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and is referred to the tropical-subtropical zone. Surface-water species (Globigerinoides ruber, G. trilobus, G. sacculifer, and G. conglobatus) dominate over deep-water species (Globorotalia inflata, G. tumida, G. menardii, and Sphaeroidinella dehiscens). Identification keys to species of Globorotalia, Globigerina, and Globigerinoides from the KwaZulu-Natal Bight are provided.

ID LAND MOLLUSKS; STREPTAXIDAE; PULMONATA
AB Nineteen stations were surveyed and 46 species of terrestrial molluscs were recorded from an 18x55 km area in the north-eastern corner of Mozambique. Three stations on Cabo Delgado (a peninsula at the northern extremity of the Quirimbas Archipelago) yielded 19 species that were not found on the inland-sampled area and 18 species that occur inland were not found on Cabo Delgado, with nine species inhabiting both areas. The main ecological difference between Cabo Delgado and the inland area is the abundance of limestone in the former and the total lack of it in the latter. The reference to the original publication, type locality, size of the type specimen(s) and summary geographical distribution as well as colour photographs are provided for each recorded species. One new species of Gulella (Pulmonata: Streptaxidae) is described from Cabo Delgado.

AB A new species of the tracheline sac spider genus Poachelas Haddad & Lyle, 2008 (Araneae: Corinnidae), presently known only from southern Africa, is described. The genus has been represented by three species, all of which are suspected to be closely associated with grasses. The new species described here, P. refugus sp. n., is known only from females collected at the type locality, Tembe Elephant Park in Maputaland, South Africa. New collecting records of the type species of the genus, P. striatus Haddad & Lyle, 2008, described from three localities in the central Free State Province of South Africa and with a distribution range of about 100 km, are presented. The species is widespread throughout the province, and is also recorded from the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Mpumulanga provinces for the first time, expanding its range to approximately 900 km.

AB The dark sac spiders of the genus Cetonana Strand, 1929 (Corinnidae: Trachelinae) of the Afrotropical Region are revised. Following a detailed comparison of the somatic and genitalic morphology of the Afrotropical C. martini (Simon, 1897) with the European type species, C. laticeps (Canestrini, 1868), Afroceto gen. n. is established to include the transfer of two Afrotropical species previously described in Cetonana, namely A. martini (Simon, 1897) comb. n. (type species) and A. coenosa (Simon, 1897) comb. n. Three species are proposed as junior synonyms of A. martini, namely C. curvipes (Tucker, 1920) syn. n., C. tridentata (Lessert, 1923) syn. n. and C. simoni (Lawrence, 1942) syn. n. The type of C. aculifera (Strand, 1916) from Madagascar is presumed destroyed and this species is considered nomen dubium. Additionally, 12 new Afroceto gen. n. species are described from southern Africa, namely A. arca sp. n., A. bulla sp. n., A. bisulca sp. n., A. capensis sp. n., A. corcula sp. n., A. croeseri sp. n., A. flabella sp. n., A. gracilis sp. n., A. plana sp. n., A. porrecta sp. n., A. rotunda sp. n. and A. spicula sp. n. Afroceto gen. n. species display variable ecological preferences, occurring in tree canopies, lower foliage strata, bark, and on the ground in contrasting habitats (forests, savannah, grassland, karoo and fynbos) in southern Africa, with single records from Malawi and Tanzania. Patelloceto gen. n., closely resembling Afroceto gen. n. but distinguished by the reduced leg spination and distinctive genitalic morphology, is also described, with three new species, P. secutor sp. n. (type species), P. denticulata sp. n. and P. media sp. n. from southern, central and east Africa. Patelloceto gen. n. species are primarily arboreal, occurring in tree canopies, lower foliage strata or on bark in forests and savannahs.

ID MILLIPEDES; AFRICA; GENERA
AB The millipede genus Zinophora (Chamberlin, 1927) was previously revised based on the species present south of the Zambezi and Kunene Rivers. Since that revision, two additional new species have been discovered and are here described: Zinophora lobata (Mozambique) and Z. taromberai (Zimbabwe and Tanzania). This brings the total number of described species in the genus to 21. An updated key to species in the genus is presented. Detailed illustrations of the gonopods supplement the descriptions and a distribution map of Z. taromberai in Zimbabwe is provided. There appear to be up to three species groups in the genus and the character states defining these groups are discussed.

AB Moegistorhynchus longirostris Wiedemann, 1819 has the longest proboscis relative to body size of all known insects. It is a keystone species along the west coast of South Africa, where it pollinates, partly or exclusively, the long-tubed flowers of at least 20 species of Iridaceae, Geraniaceae and Orchidaceae. M. longirostris has been widely discussed in the pollination biology literature and has a suggested co-evolutionary arms race between it and the long-tubed flowers it pollinates.
   A current taxonomic revision has presented new biogeographical and morphometric data. Available records suggest that the species is widely distributed along the west coast of South Africa between about 29 degrees 30'S and 34 degrees 15'S, a distance of almost 500 km. It is restricted to sandy, lowland coastal plains at less than 300 m, where it occurs in nine different vegetation types across seven bioregions and is consequently not a habitat specialist.
   Proboscis length from 13 localities ranged from 32 to 83 mm, and mean proboscis length at these localities from 32 to 71 mm. There was a decline in proboscis length with increasing latitude south. Research investigating a possible allometric relationship between body size and proboscis length, and between latitude and proboscis length, is required.

AB Two new species of Labenopimplinae, Labenopimpla orapa sp. n. and Rugopimpla botswana sp. n., are described from the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) deposits of Orapa in Botswana. These are the first and only known Cretaceous Ichneumonidae from the southern hemisphere. The new species seem to be very similar to their relatives from the Cenomanian of the Russian Far East. This indicates a wide distribution of Ichneumonidae by the early Late Cretaceous at least.

ID BRACHYCERA ASILOIDEA
AB In revising the taxonomy of Acnephalum Macquart, 1838 it was discovered that the Afrotropical species are not congeneric when compared with the Palaearctic type species (A. olivierii Macquart, 1838 from Greece), which is congeneric with species of Pycnopogon Loew, 1847. As a consequence all Palaearctic Pycnopogon species are transferred to Acnephalum which takes precedence over Pycnopogon. In addition it was found that Sporadothrix Hermann, 1907, a genus previously synonymised with Acnephalum, is worthy of full generic reinstatement. The new genus Acnephalomyia is provided for Afrotropical species previously assigned to Acnephalum. The following taxonomic adjustments, innovations and decisions are introduced in this paper:
   New combinations: Species transferred from Pycnopogon - Acnephalum apicalis (Matsumura, 1916), Acnephalum apiformis (Macquart, 1849), Acnephalum denudatus (Seguy, 1949), Acnephalum fasciculatus (Loew, 1847), Acnephalum hirsutus (Becker, 1913), Acnephalum laniger (Dufour, 1833), Acnephalum leucostomus (Engel, 1939), Acnephalum melanostomus (Loew, 1874), Acnephalum mixtus (Loew, 1847), Acnephalum nikkoensis (Matsumura, 1916), Acnephalum pallidipennis (Brulle, 1936). Species transferred from Acnephalum Acnephalomyia andrenoides (Wiedemann, 1828); Acnephalomyia dorsalis (Macquart, 1838); Acnephalomyia platygaster (Loew, 1858); Afroholopogon futilis (Wulp, 1899).
   New synonyms: Dasypogon quadratus Wiedemann, 1828, Acnephalum punctipennis Macquart, 1855, Acnephalum cockerelli Curran, 1934 and Sisyrnodytes sericeus Oldroyd, 1974 = Acnephalomyia andrenoides (Wiedemann, 1828); Acnephalum cylindricum Oldroyd, 1974 = Sporadothrix gracilis Hermann, 1907.
   New genera: Acnephalomyia (Type species: Dasypogon andrenoides Wiedemann, 1828), Astiptomyia (Type species: Astiptomyia bikos sp. n.).
   New species: Acnephalomyia eremia (Namibia), Acnephalomyia iota (Namibia, South Africa), Acnephalomyia leukoros (South Africa), Acnephalomyia probolos (South Africa), Ammodaimon platythrix (Namibia), Astiptomyia bikos (Namibia).
   Lectotype designations: Dasypogon andrenoides Wiedemann, 1828; Acnephalum dorsale Macquart, 1838; Acnephalum futile Wulp, 1899.
   Keys, tables and illustrations are provided for Afrotropical taxa as identification aids while distribution maps are included where appropriate.

AB The original structure and functioning of the historical Mfolozi-St Lucia estuarine system are described and anthropogenic impacts, which resulted in the Mfolozi and Msunduzi rivers being separated from the St Lucia Estuary and having their own combined mouth to the sea, are detailed. An overview is provided of the current ecological status of three major faunal groups, zooplankton, benthos and fish, present in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system, a system upon which, until recently, virtually no scientific research had been conducted. Currently, decreased rainfall and extended closure of the St Lucia mouth have resulted in this system being under major ecosystem stress. Management options, both short- and long-term, related to reconnecting the Mfolozi-Msunduzi to a common mouth with St Lucia are considered. These include the re-establishment of sediment-filtering swamps in the lower reaches of the Mfolozi and Msunduzi rivers, as well as the construction of levees that would protect the bulk of the adjacent land on which sugar cane is farmed. Concern is expressed regarding potential problems that may arise as a result of the reconnection of the two systems.

AB The mesozooplankton of the Mfolozi and Msunduzi estuaries, which share a combined mouth, was sampled twice per year during a two-year period of relatively low river flow. Samples were collected during March, after the rainy season when the estuary mouth was open, and during August, after the low-rainfall winter months when the mouth was closed. The estuarine calanoid copepods Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and Acartia natalensis were numerically dominant, making up 75% of the total number of mesozooplankton recorded. Relatively high abundances were recorded for these copepods, with P. stuhlmanni reaching peak densities of 79 000 individuals m-3. In the low-salinity regions of the estuaries, especially the upper regions of the Msunduzi, the cladoceran Moina sp. also attained high densities, reaching 50 000 individuals m-3. During sampling sessions when the mouth of the estuaries was closed the systems became relatively fresh, in contrast to open-mouth conditions when seawater dominated the lower reaches. Peak densities of estuarine copepods occurred during times of mouth closure. When the mouth was open these copepods generally declined in number, and an influx of coastal marine species such as paracalanids, Corycaeidae and chaetognaths was evident. Although higher zooplankton densities were mostly recorded in the Msunduzi Estuary, the species compositions in the two systems were relatively similar, with no significant differences between them. The Mfolozi Estuary is normally classified as a river mouth type, but during the present study this estuary effectively functioned as a temporarily open/ closed type estuary. The low-flow conditions did not adversely affect the estuarine mesozooplankton, largely because the mouth never remained closed for any extended period.

ID ST-LUCIA; LAKE; PERIOD
AB The Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system historically shared a common mouth with the St Lucia estuarine system. In 1952, a separate mouth was created, 1.5 km south of St Lucia mouth, to prevent silt carried by the Mfolozi River from entering Lake St Lucia. Despite its proximity to the comparatively well-studied St Lucia Estuary, there is very little information on the Mfolozi- Msunduzi estuarine system in general and no information on its benthos. In the present study, 17 taxa were recorded from biannual quantitative sampling in 2007 and 2008. Results indicated that the system was dominated by the polychaetes Ceratonereis sp., Dendronereis arborifera and Capitella capitata, the crab Paratylodiplax blephariskios and the tanaid Apseudes digitalis. The main factors influencing the distribution of the benthos were oxygen concentration, temperature, the open or closed state of the mouth, and salinity, with particle size and organic content of the substratum also being important in determining community structure. Although the dominant taxa were previously recorded as abundant in St Lucia, numbers present in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system were generally lower than those recorded in St Lucia, suggesting that periodic flooding and the unstable nature of the sediments in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi prevented its benthos from attaining the densities recorded in the adjacent St Lucia Estuary. While the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system is classified as a river mouth, its benthos was more similar in composition to that of the Mhlathuze and Mlalazi estuaries, which are classified as an estuarine bay and a permanently open estuary, respectively. It is suggested that reclassification of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system as a permanently open estuary would be more appropriate in terms of its benthos.

DE colonisation; drought; management; mouth closure; salinity; zoobenthos
ID PROLONGED DROUGHT; BENTHIC FAUNA; LAKE; RECOVERY; PERIOD
AB The onset of a prolonged drought in the St Lucia catchment in 2002 and subsequent mouth closure raised concern for the biota of the estuary. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife proposed a scheme whereby the Mfolozi-Msunduzi mouth would be closed, causing fresh water to enter the St Lucia Estuary to prevent excessively hypersaline conditions (65) from developing in the lower and middle reaches of the St Lucia system. Although this proposal caused concern about the impact of mouth closure on the ecology of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system, it raised its potential as a source of benthic fauna dispersal into, and the restocking of, the St Lucia system. Quantitative benthic sampling in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system in 2007 and 2008 revealed a benthic community generally dominated by polychaetes which, although low in terms of total species richness compared with St Lucia, included elements of a core benthic group present in the St Lucia system throughout the current drought. The presence of the gravimetrically important crab Paratylodiplax blephariskios in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system was considered important as a source from which the once-abundant population in the St Lucia Narrows could be restocked via dispersal through the channel linking the Mfolozi-Msunduzi Estuary to St Lucia. It was concluded that, while the input of fresh water from the Mfolozi River is necessary to ameliorate hypersaline conditions and conserve the important core benthic group in the Narrows and South Lake, consideration must be given to allowing sufficient tidal exchange in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi system to maintain its stocks of benthos with an obligate marine phase.

AB The fish community of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system was investigated with particular emphasis on its role as a nursery area for marine fish when the adjacent St Lucia mouth is closed. The mouth was open during March 2007 and 2008 with high-turbidity river water flowing into the sea, and was closed during August 2007 and 2008. Fish were sampled biannually with seine-nets during March and August in 2007 and 2008 at five sites throughout the system. A total of 5 886 fish from 59 species were recorded, with a higher number of species and CPUE in the Mfolozi Estuary than in the Msunduzi Estuary. Seine-net catches were dominated by Ambassis gymcocephalus, Ambassis natalensis, Leiognathus equula and Valamugil cunnesius. Juveniles of marine spawning species were present throughout the study period, even when the mouth was closed. The sampled fish assemblage structure was influenced by significant temporal differences between the four biannual sampling seasons, with relatively small spatial differences between the sampling areas. Temperature, salinity and sediment characteristics were most responsible for the structure of the fish assemblage as sampled by seine-nets. The results emphasise the importance of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system as an alternate nursery area.

AB Structure and pattern of mesozooplankton in three tidal estuaries experiencing contrasting salinity gradients were investigated. In the Kariega Estuary, where freshwater inflow was persistently low with little variation in flow, salinity values exceeded 28-30 for long periods (years) throughout the estuary. In the Keiskamma and Great Fish estuaries intermittent floods, coupled to strong and variable baseflows, ensured spatial and temporal variability in salinity distribution. Copepods numerically dominated the zooplankton (95-97%) in all three estuaries. Species richness in the freshwater-starved Kariega Estuary exceeded 35, coupled with reduced variance in abundance and low species dominance at most sites along the estuary. By contrast, the Keiskamma and Great Fish estuaries had relatively few species (21 and 20, respectively), high population variance and high species dominance at most sites. Two mesozooplankton species emerged as possible indicators of freshwater-rich and freshwater-starved estuaries. The copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei was particularly abundant in the Keiskamma and Great Fish, following the pattern recorded for other estuaries with strong horizontal salinity gradients (28). By contrast, population density of P. hessei was orders of magnitude lower in the marine-dominated Kariega. The copepod Tortanus capensis was present only in the Kariega Estuary. Characteristically, T. capensis favours upper estuarine reaches or sheltered marine embayments where salinity values consistently remain above c. 33-34 for long periods (months to years). The zooplankton of freshwater-rich estuaries is essentially a subset of the community found in freshwater-starved estuaries, and a reducing supply of fresh water to estuaries leads to estuarine mesozooplankton communities moving along a trajectory of increasing species richness, but decreasing variance and dominance within assemblages.

AB The feeding ecology of the caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi in the temporarily open/closed Kasouga Estuary, Eastern Cape, was examined during summer and winter employing stomach fullness index (SFI) analysis. Mean SFI values for male and female shrimp during summer ranged from 0.85% to 2.36% and from 0.56% and 2.61% body dry weight, respectively. During winter, SFI values for males and females were lower, and varied between 0.23% and 1.56% and 0.36% and 1.84% body dry weight, respectively. There were no significant differences in the SFI values between males and females during the two seasons. A peak in the feeding activity for both sexes was observed during the daytime during both summer and winter. For both males and females, non-linear regression analysis best explained the change in SFI over time. The gut evacuation rate constants (k) of males and females during summer were estimated at 0.43 h-1 and 0.30 h-1, respectively. These values correspond to a daily food intake equivalent to 16.2% body dwt for males and 11.1% body dwt for females. During winter, the gut evacuation rates of the shrimp were estimated at 0.35 h-1 for males and 0.28 h-1 for females. The daily ration for adult male and female shrimp during winter was estimated at 6.1% and 6.8% body dwt, respectively. The lower estimates obtained during winter appear largely to reflect the influence of the reduced water temperatures on the metabolic activities of the shrimp.

TI From self interest to public interest: Promoting higher levels of
   business ethics
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Ethics; moral development; public interest; self interest
AB While there has been widescale acknowledgement of the importance of business ethics, it is evident that many businesses still conduct themselves unethically. This paper adapts Lawrence Kohlberg's study on moral development to provide insight into the different levels of impact that self interest and public interest may have on promoting higher levels of business ethics. By drawing on Kohlberg's stages of moral development, an attempt is made to show the importance of public interest in promoting higher levels of business ethics. Attention is devoted to the capacity of businesses driven by public interest over self interest in curbing unethical conduct. While some may argue that businesses are notably motivated by self interest, there is also evidence that businesses also act for moral purposes primarily out of concern for the public. It is suggested that at stage 2 of the preconventional level of cognitive moral development which can be associated with self interest, business ethics is promoted at a lower level. However, at stage 4 of the conventional level which can be associated with public interest, business ethics is promoted at a higher level.

TI Enhancing an ethical culture through purpose -directed leadership for
   improved public service delivery: A case for South Africa
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Ethics; leadership; public service
AB The fundamental purpose of government departments is to provide services to satisfy public needs. Public leaders have to take on organisational roles to decide how to best achieve the organisation's purpose of meeting human needs and enhancing human life. An ethical culture underpinning purpose-driven leadership is viewed as an effective approach that will promote the broader interests of society in respect of public service delivery. This article focuses on the possible contribution of a purpose-directed leadership approach within the South African public service toward enhancing ethical behaviour which can ultimately translate into improved public service delivery. Attention is devoted to the capacity of such an approach in creating a milieu of commitment toward service excellence, this article argues that unethical behaviour in the public service has impacted on the quality of service delivery in many government departments in South Africa. A review of reports by the Public Service Commission and the media suggest that quality public service delivery has been affected by the lack of an ethical culture within purpose directed leadership. Through a detailed review of literature and documents relating to poor public service delivery in South Africa, it has become imperative to explore the effect of ethical and purpose-directed leadership on public service delivery. This article further argues that through ethical and purpose driven leadership, the mission statement of the public service is not only communicated to all concerned, but it is also clarified and understood and becomes the driving force in delivering what is to be achieved, without compromising the quality of public services. Performance in support of the purpose can be the building blocks upon which an ethical culture is developed throughout all government departments. Public leaders must therefore use the organisational purpose as a frame of reference for the execution of all functions within the organisation so that public satisfaction can be best achieved, without compromising ethical behaviour. The public service needs to accord greater importance and focus to leadership based on purpose-driven activities to address some of the ethical issues affecting quality service delivery. Some of the ethical issues include conflict of interest, mismatch post appointments and lack of commitment to quality service delivery. By adhering to the purpose, the principles of public service delivery beyond personal aspirations and ambitions are prioritised. The study is contextualized through a general overview of the role of leadership, within an ethical and purpose-directed framework, in promoting quality services in the public sector.

AB The Clicking Stream Frog (Strongylopus grayii) occurs throughout southern and eastern South Africa across summer, aseasonal and winter rainfall areas. Because of its contiguous distribution and extended breeding season this species might be expected to show a phylogeographic pattern of isolation by distance rather than divergent geographical lineages. To investigate population structure and make inferences about physical processes that have influenced gene flow in this species, two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S) were sequenced for 64 frogs from across the distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) revealed two well-supported clades partitioning the range of this taxon, with one clade restricted to the northeast (summer rainfall) and the other restricted to the south (winter and aseasonal rainfall). The magnitude of sequence divergence between these clades is higher than expected, and is typical of levels of sequence divergence found among closely related species of pyxicephalid frogs. Phylogeographic analyses of sequence networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) revealed additional geographical structure within each of these lineages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of climatic transitions as barriers to gene flow and as potential agents for vicariant speciation.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Point distribution data were used to evaluate the biogeographical influence of the arid Tankwa Karoo Basin on the distribution of reptiles in the south-western districts of South Africa. Under-representation of the Tankwa Karoo in the dataset required an additional field survey of this region. Prior to the survey, available records from the Tankwa Karoo Basin represented only 13 reptile species. A total of 36 species (24 lizards, nine snakes, three chelonians) was recorded during our survey of this area. Turnover across the Basin is high, species richness is lower than in surrounding mountainous areas and there are no species endemic to the area. The Tankwa Karoo Basin acts as a dispersal barrier for many reptile species occurring in the surrounding more mesic areas. At the same time, the ranges of a number of typical northern, arid-adapted species extend southward along the Tankwa plains. A number of species range extensions in the region are reported.

AB The migration of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae between their feeding and breeding areas has thus far been considered a highly predictable and seasonal event. However, previous observations on the humpbacks that pass through the nearshore waters of the west coast of South Africa have revealed deviations from the behaviour and seasonality expected during a typical migration. This 'anomaly' is hypothesised to be associated with prey availability in the region. Shore-based observations between July 2001 and February 2003 from North Head, Saldanha Bay, in the Western Cape province, yielded relative abundances that again did not support a classical migration pattern, with the highest sighting rates from mid-spring through summer. Movement parameters (actual swimming speed, direction and linearity) of humpback groups tracked by theodolite showed mid-spring to be a turning point in their behaviour, after which we observed a significant reduction in actual swimming speed, an increase in 'non-directional' movement, and a distribution farther from shore than in other seasons. Additional data on group composition and sex collected between 1993 and 2008 showed a significantly female-biased sex ratio during mid-spring, the first such recorded for any region. Direct observation of feeding on crustacean prey during spring and summer further supports the notion that humpbacks may have more flexible foraging habits than previously appreciated, and that the southern Benguela upwelling region may function as an important feeding area for these whales.

FX The fieldwork at Saldanha was supported by the National Research
   Foundation, South Africa (Grant number 2047517), and in 2002/2003 also
   by the Earthwatch Institute, the Mazda Wildlife Fund (through the
   provision of a field vehicle), and SASOL (through the donation of two
   four-stroke engines). PADI Project AWARE (UK) provided funding for
   refurbishing the lookout. JB gratefully received a grant-in-aid from the
   Society for Marine Mammalogy and University of Pretoria post-graduate
   bursaries (2001-2003). We are extremely indebted to the South African
   Navy for granting access to the lookout positions at Baviaansberg and
   Malgaskop, and allowing us to use a mooring at the Prasident Jetty, and
   to Prof. J Malan and Col. N Slabber of the South African Military
   Academy for the provision of logistical help, including access to
   computer facilities and accommodation. Data collection would have been
   impossible without the enthusiastic assistance of a total of 13
   Earthwatch and nearly 100 other local and international volunteers, to
   all of whom we owe a big debt of gratitude. Particular thanks are due to
   Maria Sabo, Erich Koch, Simon Elwen, Shaun Dillon, Theoni Photopoulos,
   Laura Beskers, Isabelle Fontaine, Pauline Delos, Andre du Randt, Jenny
   Brash and Nick van Barneveld who all volunteered for longer than four
   weeks. We are grateful to the Sackler Institute for Comparative
   Genomics, American Museum of Natural History, in particular Drs George
   Amato and Rob DeSalle, and Matt Leslie and Jacqueline Ay-Ling Loo. Lara
   Atkinson is thanked for assistance with multivariate analyses and
   PRIMER. The South African Naval Hydrographic Office kindly supplied
   tidal height measurements, and the South African Weather Service,
   climate data for Cape Columbine. This work was conducted under permits
   issued to PBB in terms of Regulation 58 of the Marine Living Resources
   Act (Act No. 18 of 1998).

AB White stumpnose Rhabdosargus globiceps were sampled over 24 months in Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa. The species is a rudimentary hermaphrodite, with <1% of mature fish having simultaneously developed ovaries and testes. Spawning activity extended from September to March and peaked in October and February. Mature males developed spawning colouration in spring, which can be used as an indicator of spawning activity. The amount of abdominal fat correlated with the spawning cycle in both sexes, suggesting that abdominal fat reserves are used in the development of gonads. Seasonal variation in the condition index suggests a slightly greater investment in reproduction by males than females. Females grew slightly faster than males and attained a larger size. The Saldanha Bay fish grew more rapidly and matured earlier than fish from populations on the south coast of South Africa. Age-at-50% maturity was 2+ for females and 1+ for males, and size-at-50% maturity was 222 mm (fork length) for females and 194 mm for males. It is necessary to use area-specific growth and life-history parameters for the assessment of the stock status of white stumpnose in South Africa.

AB Biological data for Umbrina robinsoni were obtained from fish sampled monthly during 2001-2002 by shore-angling in the warm-temperate De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA) (n = 312), and by means of spearfishing during three trips (May, September and January 2001-2002) in the Kosi Bay region of the subtropical Maputaland MPA (n = 354). Annuli in otolith sections were validated by means of marginal increment analyses and fluorochrome marking (oxytetracycline). Maximum ages recorded were 12 and 16 years at Kosi Bay and De Hoop respectively. Kosi Bay fish obtained a significantly greater asymptotic length than De Hoop fish and mean length-at-age (for ages 2-10 years) was significantly greater. The fitted von Bertalanffy growth equations for combined sexes were: L-t = 594 (1 - e(-0.183(t+2.42))) for De Hoop and L-t = 875 (1 - e(-0.151(t+2.49))) for Kosi Bay. Trends in mean monthly gonadosomatic indices and proportions of histologically validated macroscopic gonad stages indicated a summer spawning season (November-February) at De Hoop and year-round spawning at Kosi Bay. Relative condition peaked in both spring and autumn at De Hoop but showed little seasonal variation in the Kosi Bay region. Kosi Bay females attained 50% sexual maturity at a significantly larger size (48 vs 39 cm) but at younger age (2.8 vs 3.4 years) than those at De Hoop. Analysis of maturity schedules indicates that current sizes at maturity are plastic responses that maximise lifetime fecundity within local regimes of somatic growth and natural mortality. The instantaneous rate of natural mortality was substantially higher at Kosi Bay than at De Hoop (M = 0.35 vs M = 0.26).

AB The study quantifies the effects of season, age and feeding regime on glucose, glycogen, proteins and lipids in abalone Haliotis midae tissues, and to assess water loss during simulated live export. Abalone of two age classes, younger (similar to 30 months old) and older (similar to 38 months old), were subjected to four dietary regimes: two single feeds, kelp and an artificial feed, and two rotational feeding regimes utilising kelp and the artificial feed in varying ratios. Total protein, free glucose, glycogen and total lipid content were determined in the digestive gland and foot/adductor muscle. One subset of older animals, from each feeding treatment, was subjected to water content analysis by drying. Subsets of older and younger animals were subjected to a simulated live export trial to determine mass loss. Digestive gland tissue proved to be of little value for routine monitoring. Muscle glucose, muscle lipid and muscle protein concentrations were affected by month and age. Muscle glycogen concentration was affected by month, age and feeding regime. During simulated export trials, animals lost on average 15% body mass, being significantly higher (p < 0.01) in younger compared to older animals. Feeding regime did not influence susceptibility to mass loss during export. Animal age influenced the biochemical composition and export performance of abalone.

AB Present knowledge of ocean currents based on in situ observation and models suggests that passive biological material such as eggs and larvae can be advected offshore away from the Agulhas Bank, South Africa, and hence removed from the ecosystem on which their survival and recruitment depends. Such losses have been cited as the root cause of the sudden drop in annual squid catches experienced in 2001. In this study, a Lagrangian IBM (individual-based model) coupled to a ROMS (regional ocean model system) model was used to investigate this hypothesis. Three simulations were performed for 12 model months using neutrally buoyant particles released from the seabed (120 m) every second day on the mid-shelf of the eastern, central and western regions of the Agulhas Bank. Boundary effects and resolution precluded the release of virtual particles on the inshore spawning grounds. Particles were given lifespans of 40 days. Results demonstrated large particle losses from the eastern Agulhas Bank (76%) and the western Agulhas Bank (64%). In contrast, few particles were lost from the central Agulhas Bank (2%), making this, in terms of the model, the most suitable place on the Agulhas Bank for spawning. Visualisation of the ROMS outputs revealed that leakage on the eastern Agulhas Bank was caused by a cyclonic eddy resident in the Agulhas Bight. Similarly, leakage from the western Agulhas Bank was caused by deep-water cyclonic eddies in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean.

AB Maputo Bay, on the coast of Mozambique, is a tidally energetic, subtropical embayment in a region subjected to strong seasonal rainfall. Data from moored current meters, tide gauges and monthly bay-wide surveys were used to characterise the evolution of the density structure on seasonal, fortnightly and semi-diurnal time-scales and its relation to tidal forcing. The bay is subjected to large seasonal variations in freshwater input (10-10(3) m(3) s(-1)) and pronounced fortnightly variations in tidal amplitude with a spring: neap tide ratio varying between 3.6 and 9.0 with a corresponding variation in tidal stirring power input (10(-3)-1 W m(-3)). During the dry season, the water column was continuously fully mixed with weak horizontal density gradients. In contrast, during the wet season, freshwater buoyancy induced marked horizontal salinity gradients and stratification, which was pronounced around the time of neap tides. This stratification was largely eroded at spring tides but semi-diurnal, periodic stratification was still evident. A potential energy anomaly model was used to demonstrate that this periodic component of stratification was largely a result of tidal straining acting locally, with an additional contribution of stratified water advected from outside the bay during the last stages of the flood tide. Simulations using the Delft3D-Flow hydrodynamic model gave a realistic account of the tidal regime in the bay, but achieved only qualitative success in the hindcasting of the changes in water column structure and horizontal exchange. The model indicated a wet season salinity deficit of 2-3 times that of the observed values and wet season temperatures were similar to 2-3 degrees C higher than those observed. The model also underestimated the intensity of stratification in the wet season. These shortcomings all suggest an overestimate of vertical mixing by the model's turbulence closure scheme.

AB Vertical distributions of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax eggs and larvae within the upper 50 m of the water column on the eastern Agulhas Bank, South Africa, were examined using discrete depth samples collected with a multiple, opening/closing plankton net. Eggs and larvae of sardine and anchovy had significantly different vertical distributions with eggs closer to the surface and larvae deeper for both species. Eggs of both anchovy and sardine were concentrated near the surface, but their vertical distribution patterns differed significantly with sardine eggs being generally closer to the surface than anchovy eggs. Early-and late-stage anchovy eggs were mainly near the surface, but had significantly different depth distributions, whereas most middle-stage eggs were at depth. This high, near-surface abundance of early-stage anchovy eggs on the eastern Agulhas Bank differs from observations made on the western Agulhas Bank, indicating that anchovy spawn at shallower depths on the eastern Bank. There were significant differences between the vertical distributions of small (<7 mm standard length; SL) and large (>= 7 mm SL) anchovy larvae, suggesting that the larger larvae exhibit vertical migratory behaviour.

AB A model of the interactive effects of disturbance and productivity on diversity predicts peak diversity to shift towards higher disturbance regimes as productivity increases, confining the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis to intermediate productivity levels. We conducted a two-factorial (disturbance, nutrients) field experiment to test the validity of this model for two subtropical intertidal rocky shores. Treatment responses varied between distinct community types at two sites. Intensified disturbance increased evenness, and under high nutrient enrichment decreased species richness of communities dominated by encrusting algae, whereas turf-dominated communities remained unaffected. Nutrient additions increased biomass and modulated community composition at both sites, in addition to increasing species richness in encrusting-algal and decreasing evenness of turf-forming assemblages. Thus, only highly enriched encrusting-algal communities followed the model predictions. Different mechanisms appear to control species coexistence in different types of communities, some violating the assumptions of the tested model, i.e. resource limitation and competitive exclusion.

Currently, the former species is harvested in large quantities (about 5 000 tonnes wet weight per year) as abalone feed. In order to set limits to the amount of kelp that may be harvested, it is necessary to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of kelp biomass. Biomass estimates are traditionally obtained by destructive sampling of kelp sporophytes from quadrats placed on the bottom. Scuba divers harvest the plants and weigh them ashore. This method is slow and labour-intensive, and severely limits the area of kelp bed that can be sampled. This study investigates several alternative methods to determine an easier, quicker method of estimating kelp biomass. First, morphometric data on both species of kelp were collected to investigate if there were easily measurable characters that correlate with the weights of individual sporophytes, which then could be used as proxies for destructive sampling. Second, floating quadrats were used to establish correlations between the density of kelp heads at the water surface during low spring tides and kelp biomass. Good correlations were found between (1) individual sporophyte weight and stipe weight for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r(2) = 0.5693) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r(2) = 0.6175), and (2) individual sporophyte weight and stipe length for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r(2) = 0.5828) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r(2) = 0.4817). Such measurements are time consuming and labour intensive, and require scuba and destructive sampling. However, using floating 1 m(2) surface quadrats, good correlations were found between the density of kelp heads at the surface and the biomass of kelp (E. maxima, p = 0.0000, r(2) = 0.3469; L. pallida, p = 0.0000, r(2) = 0.4785). Surface density measurements are more than eight times quicker than the traditional biomass determination method, are non-destructive, require fewer personnel, can be done by snorkelling and are unaffected by water clarity. Furthermore, harvesting for abalone feed is boat-based and targets only surface-reaching kelp. Sporophytes of E. maxima that reach the surface at low water spring tide comprise on average 62% of the total biomass of kelp in these beds, so scuba should still be used where observations and measurements of subcanopy biota are required.

AB Boat ADCP surveys and an eight-month deployment of a 1 200 kHz ADCP were used to study the nearshore (5-25 m depth) current and temperature patterns along the eastern coastal region of Algoa Bay, on the south-east coast of South Africa. The boat surveys showed three distinct alongshore current patterns: all eastward, all westward, and a complex mix of flows. High variance in the upper layers of the water column, possibly caused by rip currents, eliminated the use of ADCP mooring data between 0-9 m, but analysis of the remainder of the data (10-19 m) indicated a dominant alongshore current alternating between eastward and westward flows, with velocities of up to 75 cm s(-1) at a depth of 10 m and 65 cm s(-1) at 19 m. Average velocities for these depths were 17.6 cm s(-1) and 10.8 cm s(-1) respectively. The frequency of eastward flow almost equalled westward flow (56% vs 47% respectively) over this period. A good correlation between wind and current direction indicated wind to be the primary driving force of the nearshore currents in eastern Algoa Bay. Net monthly displacement in the midwater layer (10 m) ranged between 60 km and 260 km, with eastward advection in seven of the eight months under study. Net monthly displacement in the bottom layer (19 m) was eastwards for all study months, and ranged from 8 km to 296 km. These results imply a strong likelihood that neutrally buoyant, passive material such as eggs and larvae of fish and invertebrates will be exported beyond the boundaries of a proposed marine reserve (the Greater Addo Marine Protected Area) in eastern Algoa Bay and onto the Transkei shelf. Bottom temperature data from the mooring and SST satellite imagery indicated that a warm-water plume from the Agulhas Current entered Algoa Bay and influenced the coastal current and unusually increased water temperature over a period of three days. Similarly, cold water from the adjacent Port Alfred upwelling area also entered the eastern sector of Algoa Bay, more commonly than warm-water intrusions.

However, only a single Risso's dolphin attempted to strand and 13 bottlenose dolphins had to be shepherded out of the shallows the next day, the remainder leaving of their own accord. This is considered to be the first near-stranding phenomenon recorded for the region.

DT Review

   orca; reproduction; South Africa
ID ORCINUS-ORCA; MARION ISLAND; BEHAVIOR
AB The distribution, seasonality and schooling behaviour of killer whales Orcinus orca in South African waters have been investigated from 785 records compiled between 1963 and 2009, and their size, morphometrics, growth, reproduction, food and feeding behaviour described from the examination of 54 individuals, 36 of which were landed at the Durban whaling station between 1971 and 1975. Qualitatively, the species appears to be more frequently encountered offshore, where it forms small schools of generally less than six animals. Seasonality of occurrence is not marked, although circumstantial evidence indicates that some individuals migrate from higher latitudes. Males reach 8.81 m and females 7.9 m, with 16.2% of males exceeding the size of the largest female. Stomach content and observational data suggest that the species can be characterised locally as an opportunistic predator of megavertebrates, rather than as the fish-feeding ecotype previously described. A stranded adult male with extreme tooth wear that was 1.5-2 m shorter than other males of equivalent age may be representative of a separate 'offshore' ecotype. Apparent differences between features of the population's life history and those of resident killer whales in the north-eastern Pacific might be attributed to either uncertainties in age determination using dentinal growth layer groups or sampling bias. The basis for the suggestion that killer whales in South African waters should be reclassified as Vulnerable (rather than Data Deficient) is challenged.

AB The management of abalone stocks worldwide is complicated by factors such as illegal fishing combined with the difficulties of assessing a sedentary (but not immobile) resource that is often patchily distributed. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery is faced with an additional problem in the form of a relatively recent movement of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii into much of the range of the abalone. The lobsters have heavily reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone which rely on the urchins for shelter. A model is developed for abalone that is an extension of more standard age-structured assessment models because it explicitly takes spatial effects into account, incorporates the ecosystem change effect described above and estimates the magnitude of substantial illegal ('poached') catches. The model is simultaneously fitted to catch per unit effort and Fishery-Independent Abalone Survey abundance data, as well as to several years of catch-at-age (cohort-sliced from catch-at-size) data for the various components of the fishery and different spatial strata. It constitutes the first quantitative approach applied to the management of this commercially valuable resource in South Africa and has provided a basis for management advice over recent years by projecting abundance trends under alternative future catch levels.

AB Changes and fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) around the South African coast are analysed at a monthly scale from 1982 to 2009. There is a statistically significant negative trend of up to 0.5 degrees C per decade in the southern Benguela from January to August, and a cooling trend of lesser magnitude along the South Coast and in the Port Elizabeth/Port Alfred region from May to August. The cooling is due to an increase in upwelling-favourable south-easterly and easterly winds. There is a positive trend in SST of up to 0.55 degrees C per decade in most parts of the Agulhas Current system during all months of the year, except for KwaZulu-Natal where warming is in summer. The warming was attributed to an intensification of the Agulhas Current in response to a poleward shift of westerly winds and an increase in trade winds in the South Indian Ocean at relevant latitudes. This intensification of the Agulhas Current could also have contributed to the coastal cooling in the Port Alfred dynamic upwelling region. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is significantly positively correlated at a 95% level with the southern Benguela and South Coast from February to May, and negatively correlated with the Agulhas Current system south of 36 degrees S. The correlation with the Antarctic Annular Oscillation is weaker and less coherent. El Nino suppresses upwelling along the coast, whereas La Nina increases it. Although there does not seem to be a linear relationship between the strength of the ENSO and the magnitude of coastal SST perturbation, El Nino and La Nina appear to be linked to major warm and cool events, respectively, at a seasonal scale in summer in the southern Benguela and along the South Coast. However, care must be taken in interpreting low-resolution reanalysed climate data (ERA40 and NCEP) and optimally interpolated Reynolds SST, such as used here.

AB The West Coast dusky kob Argyrosomus coronus is an understudied yet important fishery species in Angola. During a five-year study (2005-2009), the species was recorded in all fishery sectors, but was most important in the inshore recreational fishery in southern Angola (Cunene Estuary to Namibe). Early juveniles (<300 mm total length, TL) were captured in the offshore artisanal fishery at Praia Pinda, whereas juveniles (300-600 mm TL), subadults (600-870 mm TL) and adults (>870 mm TL) were captured in all fisheries as far north as Namibe, and shoals of large adult fish (>1 000 mm TL) were occasionally captured in the offshore purse-seine commercial fishery between the Cunene Estuary and Lucira. Because some Argyrosomus species are morphologically cryptic, a DNA barcoding method was used to confirm the taxonomic status of the biological samples used in this study. The male: female sex ratio of examined samples was 1:1.4 (n = 225). The length-at-50% maturity was 823 mm and 904 mm TL for males and females respectively. Age-at-50% maturity was 4.4 and 4.3 years for males and females respectively. The periodicity of otolith ring formation was confirmed to be one year using a marginal zone and a chemical marking analysis. Growth (in mm TL) was best described by: L(t) = 1 826(1 - e(-0.12(t) (+ 1.60))). Argyrosomus coronus fed predominantly on fish, mainly Sardinella aurita (62% frequency of occurrence). Early juveniles appeared to frequent the offshore zone (50-100 m depth), moving into the inshore region at approximately 300 mm TL. Juveniles and subadults were resident (57% recaptured at the same site) and were particularly abundant around the mouth of the Cunene Estuary as well as in central and northern Namibia. Adults undertake migrations that correspond with the movement of the Angola-Benguela frontal zone, moving north as far as Gabon in winter and returning to southern Angola in spring, when spawning appeared to take place offshore. There are currently no catch restrictions on A. coronus in Angolan waters. However, declining catches and increasing fishing effort suggest that some management intervention is required, commencing with a proposed closure of the Cunene Estuary mouth region to fishing.

AB A method for ploidy verification of triploid and diploid Haliotis midae was developed using molecular microsatellite markers. In all, 30 microsatellite loci were tested in control populations. A final micro satellite multiplex consisting of seven markers were optimised and a complete protocol is reported. This protocol was successfully applied in identifying the ploidy levels of 42 ploidy-unknown abalone, showing the utility of microsatellite markers as tools for verifying the ploidy of individual abalone. The protocol can be applied in larger animals for which the isolation of nuclei and metaphase chromosomes from tissues is difficult.

AB This paper provides an introduction to, and overview of, the natural phenomenon known as the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run. Previous literature on this topic and hypotheses about the reasons why, and the mechanisms how, the run occurs are briefly synthesised and described. Papers contributing to this suite that detail more recent work on a variety of aspects of the sardine run, ranging from physical oceanography through sardine biology and ecology to socio-economic and ecological consequences, are outlined. Such studies will lead to improved understanding of the factors that regulate the timing and intensity of the run, which may permit predictions of whether it will occur, when fish will arrive on the KZN beaches, and how long it will persist. Such predictions would have substantial benefits for this ecologically and economically important event.

AB The annual movement of South African sardine Sardinops sagax up the east coast of South Africa, known as the 'sardine run', was investigated using data from aerial surveys for the period 1988-2005 and compared with remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a data. Sardine sighting rates were highest within the Waterfall Bluff Bight off the Eastern Cape Coast, where conditions appeared to be most favourable. Sardine and predator sightings decreased significantly northwards of Mdoni on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast, whereas the proportion of nearshore sightings increased. The causal mechanism for this inshore concentration is suggested to be the influx of warm Agulhas Current water from the Durban Eddy that forces sardine shoreward. Cape gannet Morus capensis, common dolphin Delphinus capensis and sardine distributions were associated, and there was an association between SST and sardine and predator distributions. There was a marked increase in bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus sightings upon commencement of the sardine run, with these dolphins being considered to be a 'migratory' stock that enters KZN waters every winter.

AB The nearshore presence of sardine Sardinops sagax on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast was investigated using sightings data collected by the KZN Sharks Board from 1997 to 2007. The spatio-temporal distribution of sardine was described in relation to that of their predators and to environmental conditions, and subjected to generalised linear model (GLM) and generalised additive model (GAM) analyses. Variables describing spatio-temporal conditions performed best in the models (r(2) = 0.52) with seasonal effects, specifically June and July, making the greatest contribution towards sardine presence. The contribution of the years 2003, 2006 and 2007, and the KZN North Coast, was significantly lower. The predator variables were highly significant (r(2) = 0.48) with Cape gannets Morus capensis, followed by the sharks/gamefish and common dolphins Delphinus capensis, being most closely associated with sardine presence. Environmental variables were not as influential in the GLM models (r(2) = 0.23), but some variables were useful in describing conditions favouring sardine presence, namely calm current conditions, light north-westerly land breezes and stable atmospheric conditions. Increasing sea surface temperature (SST), moderate north to south currents, large swells and turbid water had a negative impact upon sardine presence. North-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents had a cooling effect upon nearshore SSTs, whereas south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures caused nearshore warming. Results are discussed in the context of developing an understanding of the mechanisms that govern fine-scale movements of sardine shoals during the KZN sardine run, with a view to predicting such movements.

AB Catches of sardine Sardinops sagax made by the beach-seine fishery off the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast during the annual winter sardine run have been sampled intermittently since 1951, and a substantial amount of data on various biological characteristics of sardine caught off KZN now exists. Information on length frequency distributions, mean caudal length (CL), length-mass relationships, condition factor (CF), age distributions, sex ratio, gonad maturity and diet have been collated and are presented in this paper. Sardine caught off the KZN coast during the past six decades had a mean CL of 17.4 cm (SD 2.0) and have shown a significant increasing trend in mean CL through time; had substantially lower mass-at-length compared to fish that did not participate in the sardine run; have shown two distinct periods of decrease in CF between 1979 and 2005; ranged in age from 1 to 7 years but were numerically dominated by younger fish (1-, 2- or 3-year-olds); had a 1:1 sex ratio and gonads that were predominantly actively developing and undergoing maturation and vitellogenesis; and had a diet dominated by zooplankton, primarily calanoid and harpactacoid copepods and fish eggs. These characteristics, together with some information on meristic and morphological characteristics of sardine caught off KZN, are compared to characteristics of sardine from elsewhere off South Africa's coast to assess the possibility that the former may be a distinct stock or a functionally discrete adult assemblage. Significant differences in characteristics such as CF, vertebral count and body shape were found, supporting the hypothesis that KZN sardine represent a distinct stock or a functionally discrete adult assemblage. However, small sample sizes and plausible alternative explanations for these differences weaken, but do not invalidate, this hypothesis, and further work is needed to answer this question.

AB Pelagic eggs of marine fish were collected weekly from shelf waters at Park Rynie on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast from 1987 to 2007 to investigate seasonal and annual patterns in the abundance of sardine Sardinops sagax eggs. After a sudden appearance in June each year, sardine eggs were found persistently throughout the winter-spring period before disappearing in early summer. From changes in the cross-shelf distribution of eggs, it is inferred that sardine shoals are close inshore in June, as they arrive in KwaZulu-Natal waters from the south, then the shoals disperse offshore and thereafter return inshore before their return migration southward in early summer. The period 2001-2007 yielded significantly fewer eggs than the previous 14 years of the study.

AB Despite much public awareness surrounding the annual migration of sardine Sardinops sagax northward along the east coast of South Africa in winter each year, relatively little research effort has been expended to improve understanding of the 'sardine run'. For this reason, a dedicated multidisciplinary survey, timed to coincide with the annual sardine run, was conducted off the East Coast in June and July of 2005. The major objective of the survey was to estimate the biomass of sardine off the East Coast during the run, and to compare this with biomass estimates collected during previous surveys conducted in this area during the late 1980s when the South African sardine population was at a considerably smaller size. We also collected data on the distribution of sardine and other small pelagic fish species and their eggs, the biological characteristics of sardine during the run, and data on the hydrography (temperature and currents) and lower trophic levels (phytoplankton and zooplankton) of the region. Results suggest that the biomass of sardine off the East Coast in winter remains relatively small and consistent, regardless of overall sardine population size. The narrow continental shelf to the east of Port Alfred, which is dominated offshore by the fast-flowing warm Agulhas Current, constrains the amount of suitable habitat for sardine and other clupeoids such as anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, West Coast round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi and East Coast round herring Etrumeus teres, and hence precludes these species from attaining a high biomass in this region. Additionally, primary and secondary productivity levels are much lower than elsewhere on the western and eastern Agulhas Bank off the south coast of South Africa, suggesting that the sardine run is not a feeding migration. A previous hypothesis that the run is mainly a result of an expansion of the distributional range of these fish as conditions become favourable in winter due to sporadic cooling off the East Coast is also not entirely supported by results from the survey. It is suggested that a migration for the purposes of spawning off this coast when conditions become favourable is a more likely incentive for sardine to undertake this arduous journey, despite increased predation and poor feeding conditions.

AB Opportunistic observations to determine the relative abundance and distribution of marine mammal and seabird predators of sardine Sardinops sagax were carried out during a dedicated multidisciplinary research survey off the South African east coast in June and July of 2005 that was timed to coincide with the annual sardine run. Associations between different predator species, between predators and clupeoids, and between predators and oceanographic variables, were examined. Species' distributions were primarily separated by latitude and distance from shore. Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni, African penguin Spheniscus demersus, Cape cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis and West Coast round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi were predominantly found in the cool southern part of the survey region. Peak sardine run activity occurred within 4 km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water (<21 degrees C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators associated with this activity were common dolphins Delphinus capensis and Cape gannets Morus capensis, and their nearshore distribution was associated with sardine and East Coast round herring E. teres. Few clupeoids were encountered along the KwaZulu-Natal continental shelf, although patches of high sardine abundance were recorded near the shore immediately south of Durban. It is clear that during the 2005 survey the sardine run terminated in this region, probably as a result of the nearshore intrusion of warm water from the Agulhas Current.

Results showed that catch rates of five (elf Pomatomus saltatrix, garrick Lichia amia, king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, blacktip kingfish Caranx heberi and kingfish Caranx spp.) of the nine teleost predators selected for their predatory habits on sardine Sardinops sagax were significantly higher during the months of the sardine run (June-July/August). This corroborates anecdotal and scientific reports of close associations between these predatory fish and the run. It is not clear whether these relationships can be ascribed to a feeding migration by the predators, a reproductive migration by the predators or an extension of suitable habitat for both prey and predators during these months. It is possible that the misidentification of some predatory species may have confounded the results for some species, or that these species are not as strongly influenced by the sardine run as previously thought.

AB Shark catches in the protective nets set off the beaches of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, are strongly influenced by the sardine run, the winter influx of shoals of Sardinops sagax from the south-west. The effect of the sardine run, which is highly variable from year to year, is greatest in June and July at beaches south of Durban. Total annual shark catch and effort are presented for the period 1952-2005, and total monthly shark catch on the KZN south coast for the period May-August, 1965-2005. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the sardine run have been introduced and have been increasingly successful. Reliable species-specific catch data are available for the period 1978-2005 only. For this period, the spatio-temporal distribution of each of 14 species of shark and the frequency of occurrence of sardine in their diets is documented. Occurrence varies according to species, as does the apparent influence of the sardine run on shark distribution. During June and July on the KZN south coast, sardine were found in the diet of all but two species and frequency of occurrence was 40% or greater in eight species. The presence of copper or bronze whaler sharks Carcharhinus brachyurus in KZN waters appears to be strongly associated with the sardine run, as does that of certain life-history stages of dusky sharks C. obscurus. Spinner sharks C. brevipinna and smooth hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini are caught in greater numbers in summer than in winter, but appear to shift their spatial distribution seasonally to feed on sardine.

AB The economic and social effects of the annual sardine run on the indigenous community on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were assessed using data gathered from questionnaires and personal interviews with 329 members of the community. Their knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about the sardine run, as well as their level of involvement in, and the financial benefits accrued from it, were also assessed. Although around two-thirds of those interviewed were aware of the sardine run and just over half participated in it, only some 17% benefited financially from it. However, despite this low level of participation, the financial benefit to the community could amount to R17-18 million, and as much as R34-54 million if a multiplier effect of 2-3 is applied. There was a high level (over 70%) of willingness to learn more about the event, and to become more involved in training exercises that would allow local people to take advantage of opportunities arising from the sardine run. It is recommended that management strategies and development plans should be implemented towards assisting the indigenous communities to become more involved in the sardine run.

AB Understanding recreational aspects of the tourism industry developing around the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run is important for the protection and sustainability of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area (MPA), on the south-east coast of South Africa. Between June and July 2007, a total of 128 people visited this area to experience the sardine run using boat-based access. An onsite questionnaire survey of 108 (84.4%) participants at Port St Johns and Mbotyi indicated that the direct value of their visit was around R5.47 million (95% CI = R5.14-5.82 million). Although the benefits of the sardine run tourism industry extend throughout the South African economy, local indigenous communities receive little direct benefit. Almost half of all sardine run participants, however, showed a willingness to contribute R500 or more towards a community development programme. On a ranking from one (poor) to five (excellent), the average participant's response to overall quality of the experience and quality of the dive charter was 3.9 and 4.4, respectively. Over a quarter (27%) of participants never saw a sardine during their visit, despite the fact that their trip was marketed as 'the sardine run', so participant experiences often did not meet with expectations. The sardine run within the Pondoland MPA is currently an undermarketed and underexploited resource.

These include ecological impacts, such as enrichment of a largely oligotrophic environment, competition between migrant sardine Sardinops sagax, other migrant and resident small pelagic fish species, and interactions with predators, as well as the socio-economic impacts of the sardine run on the local people. Enrichment of KZN coastal waters with organic nitrogen contained within the sardine is compared with alternative sources of nitrogen such as upwelling, river, sewage and stormwater runoff, and groundwater discharge. The sardine run appears to contribute most nitrogen to this system - 96 000 t compared to 500-3 300 t for each of the other significant sources at trophic level 2, although upwelling estimates are extremely wide. Nonetheless, the majority of surviving sardine, their young and predators return southwards, suggesting that the nett export of nitrogen to KZN waters during the run is likely to be of a similar order of magnitude as that from other sources. Further, whereas the sardine supply of nitrogen is exclusively during winter, the bulk of the riverine input is in summer, thus ensuring that nitrogen supply in the region is maintained at fairly constant levels throughout the year. Competition for food between small pelagic fish is minimised by resource partitioning, but further dietary data are needed for resident species. Although interactions between sardine and top predators must exist, further studies are needed to confirm links between top predator life cycles and the sardine run. The estimated value of sardine as a tourist spectacle is compared to that from a seasonal beach-seine or boat-based purse-seine fishery for this species. Whereas the estimated value of the sardine as a tourist attraction appears substantially higher than could be derived from catching them, the small-scale beach-seine fishery itself draws tourists and also provides limited, seasonal employment opportunities.

TI Shelf currents, lee-trapped and transient eddies on the inshore boundary

AB The existence and strength of the annual KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) sardine run has long been a conundrum to fishers and scientists alike - particularly that the sardine Sardinops sagax migrate along the narrow Transkei shelf against the powerful, warm Agulhas Current. However, examination of ship-borne acoustic Doppler current profiler (S-ADCP) data collected during two research surveys in 2005 indicated that northward-flowing coastal countercurrents exist at times between the Agulhas Bank and the KZN Bight, near Port Alfred, East London, Port St Johns and Durban. The countercurrent near Port Alfred extended as far east as the Keiskamma River, within an upwelling zone known to exist there. An ADCP mooring at a depth of 32 m off Port Alfred indicated that the countercurrent typically lasted a few days, but at times remained in the same direction for as long as 10 days. Velocities ranged between 20 and 60 cm s(-1) with maximum values of similar to 80 cm s(-1). The S-ADCP data also highlighted the existence of cyclonic flow in the Port St Johns-Waterfall Bluff coastal inset, with a northward coastal current similarly ranging in velocity between 20 and 60 cm s(-1). CTD data indicated that this was associated with shelf-edge upwelling, with surface temperatures 2-4 degrees C cooler than the adjacent core temperature (24-26 degrees C) of the Agulhas Current. Vertical profiles of the S-ADCP data showed that the countercurrent, about 7 km wide, extends down the slope to at least 600 m, where it appeared to link with the deep Agulhas Undercurrent at 800 m. S-ADCP and sea surface temperature (SST) satellite data confirmed the existence of the semi-permanent, lee-trapped, cyclonic eddy off Durban, associated with a well-defined northward coastal current between Park Rynie and Balito Bay. Analysis of three months (May-July 2005) of satellite SST and ocean colour data showed the shoreward core-boundary of the Agulhas Current (24 degrees C isotherm) to commonly be close to the coast along the KZN south coast, as well as between the Kei and Mbhashe rivers on the Transkei shelf. The Port St Johns-Waterfall Bluff cyclonic eddy was also frequently visible in these satellite data. Transient cyclonic eddies, which spanned 150-200 km of shelf, appeared to move downstream in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current at a frequency of about once a month. These seemed to be break-away Durban eddies. Data collected by ADCP moorings deployed off Port Edward in 2005 showed that these break-away eddies and the well-known Natal Pulse are associated with temporary northward countercurrents on the shelf, which can last up to six days. It is proposed that these countercurrents off Port Alfred, East London and Port St Johns assist sardine to swim northwards along the Transkei shelf against the Agulhas Current, but that their progress north of Waterfall Bluff is dependent on the arrival of a transient, southward-moving, break-away Durban cyclonic eddy, which apparently sheds every 4-6 weeks, or on the generation of a Natal Pulse. This passage control mechanism has been coined the 'Waterfall Bluff gateway' hypothesis. The sardine run survey in June-July 2005 was undertaken in the absence of a cyclonic eddy on the KZN south coast, i.e. when the 'gate' was closed.

AB The term 'sardine run' is part of the cultural heritage of the South African nation and refers to a natural phenomenon that is well known to the general public but still poorly understood from an ecological perspective. This lack of understanding has stimulated numerous hypotheses, often contradictory, that try to explain why (ultimate factors) and how (proximate factors) the run occurs. Here, we provide a new definition of the term sardine run, review the various hypotheses about the run, and propose ways to test those hypotheses. Where possible, the results of tests that have been conducted thus far are presented and discussed. Our interpretation of the causes is that the sardine run most likely corresponds to a seasonal (early austral winter) reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) as far as Durban and sometimes beyond, in most years if not in every year. This eastward migration is constrained close to the coast by the thermal preference of sardine and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current. The run is facilitated by the presence of a band of cooler coastal water and by the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies that enable sardine shoals to overcome their habitat restrictions. These enabling mechanisms are most important in the area where the shelf is at its narrowest and feature most prominently off Waterfall Bluff, which has led to the coining of the 'Waterfall Bluff gateway hypothesis'. Based on the collection of eggs off the KZN coast, sardine remain there for several months and their westward, return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it likely occurs at depth as the fish avoid warmer surface waters. Years in which the sardine run is not detected by coastal observers could reflect either its real absence due to high water temperatures and/or other hydrographic barriers, or an eastward migration that is farther offshore and possibly deeper and is enabled by hydrographical anomalies.

AB The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as 'East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using historical and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximating 0.4-0.8 m-2. Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600% and 453% respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3%. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo-sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.

AB This study provides one of the first quantitative assessments of a fish community within a pre-operational deep-water port system. Between September 2006 and September 2007 a total of 4 559 fish, representing 47 species and 27 different families, were caught within the Port of Ngqura, Africa's deepest port, in 1 713 h of shore-angling (2.3 fish angler-1 h-1) and 239 h of boat-based angling (2.8 fish angler-1 h-1). Catches included species representative of both estuarine and shore fisheries. The majority (83.0%) of species caught were marine and most were less than size-at-50% maturity (71.4%). The most abundantly caught species were dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (25.5%), elf Pomatomus saltatrix (24.9%), garrick Lichia amia (17.7%) and dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus (10.7%). Fish assemblages differed significantly (p 0.05) between three habitats within the port: Dolosse, Quay Wall and Sandy Shore. The Dolosse habitat supported the greatest abundance (3.1 fish angler-1 h-1) and diversity (43) of fish species. The Port of Ngqura is thus functioning as an important habitat for both juvenile and adult fish. The diversity and abundance of fish suggests the potential use of ports and other artificial structures for enhancing local fisheries in South Africa.

AB Trends in the abundance, size and growth of newly settled pueruli and early juveniles of the rock lobster Jasus lalandii were determined from samples obtained from mesh bags used for oyster mariculture in Saldanha Bay, South Africa. Totals of 3 842 lobster pueruli and 10 158 juveniles were captured between August 2005 and June 2006, and distinct puerulus settlement events were identified in November and January. Juveniles also peaked during these months as well as in March. The size of newly settled pueruli increased significantly between October and March. The carapace length (CL) of pueruli and juveniles overlapped between 8.5 mm (smallest juvenile) and 10.4 mm (largest puerulus), and 50% of pueruli moulted into juveniles by 9.5-9.6 mm CL. There was a size progression in juveniles, with larger individuals in February and March reflecting an accumulation of juveniles from the earlier settlement events. The estimated growth increment from puerulus to first juvenile instar was 0.5-1.5 mm (4.9-16.1%), increasing to 1.4-2.5 mm (14.4-23.3%) for the second instar. Recruitment of J. lalandii pueruli occurred during periods when strong southerly winds prevailed, which results in a general offshore movement of surface waters along the West Coast and upwelling of cold nutrient-rich bottom waters. However, specific settlement events appeared to coincide with a change in wind direction, reduction in upwelling strength and increase in surface water temperatures, implying that larvae may take advantage of landward movements of surface waters during downwelling, or reversal of upwelling, to return them to shallow coastal waters.

TI Assessment of South African Umbrina robinsoni based on per-recruit

AB Slender baardman Umbrina robinsoni are an important component of recreational shore-angler and spearfisher catches along the eastern seaboard of South Africa. Stocks of U. robinsoni at three sitesFalse Bay, Stil Bay and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coastwere modelled using a per-recruit approach. Total (Z) and fishing (F) mortality rates were estimated by catch-curve analyses using measures of individual size (length or weight) recorded by researchers, divers (log books) or during spearfishing competitions. Based on estimates of F during the period 2001-2003, spawner biomass per-recruit ratios were estimated to be either at or below the 25% threshold (False Bay SB/R = 21% SB/RF = 0, Stil Bay SB/R = 25% SB/RF = 0, and KZN SB/R = 21% SB/RF = 0), suggesting that rates of F were too high. Reductions in F necessary to achieve target fishing mortality levels (FF = 0) at the current minimum size limit (l 40 cm total length) were 51% for Stil Bay and the KZN coast and 57% for False Bay. Based on the bag frequencies from 927 diver outings in KZN (1989-2003), a reduction in bag limit from the current five to two fish is predicted to reduce F in this region by approximately 25%. Increasing the l to 50 cm is predicted to increase SB/R ratios to 36% SB/RF = 0 in False Bay, 43% SB/RF = 0 in KZN and 52% SB/RF = 0 in Stil Bay, at current levels of F. Owing to the philopatric nature of U. robinsoni and the consequent existence of temporary refugia, catch curves are likely to underestimate fishing mortality. The reductions in F estimated to attain the target reference points are therefore probably conservative.

ID AGULHAS CURRENT; NATAL BIGHT; CHANNEL; MADAGASCAR
AB An investigation of the circulation patterns and thermohaline structures in the Delagoa Bight, Mozambique, was undertaken during May 2004, August 2004, April 2005, and April 2006, using hydrographic surveys, surface drifters and satellite imagery. Hydrographic and satellite data during May 2004 illustrated a cyclonic eddy centred at 26 degrees S, 34.25 degrees E in the Bight. A surface drifter remained trapped in this eddy for six weeks between 8 May and 20 June 2004 before moving southward in the Agulhas Current. During August 2004, the core of a cyclonic eddy was located south of the Bight, while no cyclonic eddy was observed during April 2005 or in April 2006. The Delagoa Bight eddy appeared to be more transient than previously thought. Important observations were the recurrent northward current (25-30 cm s-1) occurring subsurface on the shelf, and the prominence of cooler upwelled water at various locations due to the interaction of passing eddies with the bottom topography of the Bight.

AB The diet of African penguins Spheniscus demersus in Namibia consisted mainly of sardine Sardinops sagax in the 1950s. Since the collapse of pelagic fish stocks in the 1970s, birds fed mainly on bearded (pelagic) goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, a low-energy prey species. We present diet data for African penguins breeding at Mercury Island, the largest colony for this species in Namibia, between 1996 and 2009. Bearded goby was the main prey item throughout the study period, both in terms of frequency of occurrence (67.8%; SD 31.2) and in terms of mass (59.2%; SD 31.5). Diet composition varied throughout the year as well as between years; birds occasionally fed on a variety of fish species other than bearded goby. In Namibia, poor prey abundance is considered as a major factor contributing to the decline of penguin numbers after the collapse of the sardine stocks. However, bearded goby appears to be relatively abundant along Namibia's southern coast and low prey quality rather than low abundance appears to be a key factor influencing population dynamics of African penguins and other marine top predators in southern Namibia.

AB The sparid Dentex macrophthalmus is a widespread, important fishery species along most of the West African coast from southern Namibia to the Mediterranean. In southern Angola it is an important artisanal species targeted predominantly by handline fishers. A biological and fisheries study was conducted on this species in southern Angola between June 2008 and July 2009. It was the dominant species in the artisanal fishery, accounting for 99% of the sparids captured and 67% (by mass) of the total catch. The life history of D. macrophthalmus was characterised by slow growth (females: Lt = 309[1 - e-0.06(t + 5.43)], males: Lt = 248[1 - e-0.16(t - 1.77)]), advanced age at maturity (females: 7.4 years, males: 6.0 years) and high longevity (females: 36 years, males: 38 years). The sex ratio was 1:1 male:female. The length- and age-frequency distributions and macroscopic observations suggested that the species is a late gonochorist. Males and females reached 50% maturity at 151 and 166 mm fork length respectively. Although individuals with ripe gonads were found during most of the year, the peak spawning period appeared to be in December and January. Despite a life history that renders D. macrophthal-mus vulnerable to overexploitation, only 38% of artisanal fishers noticed a decline in the catches of this species. Potential reasons for this include: technology creep; limited pressure on the juvenile portion of the stock as a result of late recruitment (above the length of 50% maturity); the 'basin affect', whereby depleted areas are reseeded by areas (e.g. deeper water) inaccessible to the linefishery; and a deep-water reserve of large individuals. It is recommended that precautionary management strategies be implemented until the age estimates are revised by the countries in which this species forms significant fisheries.

AB This study describes the Thukela Banks crustacean and linefish fisheries and investigates the potential impacts of reduced flow from the Thukela River on the value of these fisheries. Data were obtained from published and unpublished material, key informants and government records. The crustacean fishery employs about 300 people, and comprises an inshore and offshore fishery. Inshore catches and effort are strongly seasonal, peaking in April to June. The probability of fishing in any particular month is positively correlated with catch per unit effort. Average overall annual catch (inshore and offshore) was estimated to be in the region of 700 tonnes for 1992-2002 with a gross output of about R36.7 million per annum, and a gross value added (net output) of R13.8 million (1 US$ = R6.40; 2003). Inshore prawns were estimated to contribute R8.5 million of the gross output. The Thukela Banks was estimated to contribute R4.5 million and R35 million (rand value in 2003) to the gross output of the commercial linefishery and boat-based recreational angling fishery respectively. Freshwater reduction scenarios yielded 0.7-11% reductions in prawn catches, which translated into only a 1-2% drop in the annual value of the fishery. The latter was attributed to the fishery's diversity (predominantly the buffering effect of bycatch) and the fact that the stocks of the species targeted by the offshore component are largely independent of flow. Catches and value of the recreational boat-based linefishery were predicted to remain fairly constant irrespective of any changes in flow. The commercial linefishery was the most responsive, with a 20% decline in total catch and 17% value predicted for the most extreme flow reduction scenario.

AB The effect of dietary protein to energy ratio (P:E) on the growth of dusky kob Argyrosomus japoni-cus was investigated as a first step towards formulating a practical diet for this potential mariculture species in South Africa. The effects of dietary protein and lipid on growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogenous waste production were determined in cultured juveniles (initial weight 113.8 +/- 2.0 g fish-1). Fish were fed diets that contained either 42 or 46% protein with 6, 12 or 18% lipid, within a P:E range of 20.5-26.7 g protein MJ-1. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were significantly influenced by an interaction between dietary protein and energy (p 0.001). An increase in dietary lipid produced increasing growth rates (ranging from 0.95 +/- 0.04% to 1.10 +/- 0.01% day-1) among fish fed the 46% protein diets, with no significant differences in FCR (1.05 +/- 0.02 to 1.11 +/- 0.02) or protein efficiency ratio (PER; 1.95 +/- 0.06 to 1.66 +/- 0.02). By contrast, there was a trend of decreasing growth (0.96 +/- 0.04% to 0.64 +/- 0.03% day-1) and a deterioration in FCR (1.3 +/- 0.10 to 1.93 +/- 0.19) and PER (1.12 +/- 0.11 to 1.68 +/- 0.11) with increasing dietary lipid among fish fed 42% protein diets, indicating a protein- energy imbalance. The protein and lipid levels tested here had no significant effect on total ammonia production, with a combined mean production of 2.54 +/- 0.55 mg kg-1 I-1 h-1, 10 hours postprandial (p = 0.68). The dietary lipid level appeared to directly determine the carcass lipid content, with the mean lipid content ranging from 4.2% to 17.8% for fish fed diets ranging from 6% to 18% respectively after 12 weeks (r2 = 0.98). A 46% protein and 18% lipid (P:E ratio of 22.0 g protein MJ-1) diet is recommended for rearing juvenile A. japonicus of a mass range of 100-300 g.

AB The effect of temporal variation in growth rate on per-recruit model outputs was investigated by comparing biological reference points obtained using growth curves derived for Umbrina robinsoni populations from False Bay, on the south coast of South Africa, sampled 10 years apart (1991-1993 and 2001-2003), and applying the two different age-length keys to length frequency data collected over the period 1991-1993 (n = 1 389) for the estimation of total mortality (Z), fishing mortality (F) and spawner biomass per recruit (SB/R). The SB/R and yield per-recruit (Y/R) curves constructed using biological data collected during the two different time periods were very similar, with target and threshold reference points differing only moderately (11%). This suggests that for long-lived species, the frequency of age and growth studies can be at least the lifespan of a cohort if they are to be assessed with a per-recruit approach. The use of the more recent length-at-age data, however, resulted in lower estimates of F (0.61 y-1 vs 1.05 y-1) and a slightly higher spawner biomass per-recruit ratio (19.5% vs 14.5%) for the earlier period. The reduced estimate of F when using the more recent dataset was likely due to a bias towards older fish caused by small sample size, the philopatric nature of U. robinsoni, and possible recruitment collapse. This highlights the importance of having a large, representative sample of length-at-age data for construction of age-length keys.

AB Given the high costs of lactation and the importance of milk for pup growth and survival in pinnipeds, nursing behaviour directed by a lactating female towards another adult is unexpected. Here, details were noted of a nursing interaction that occurred between two Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus adults. After discussing the event in the light of various hypotheses that have been previously proposed to explain uncharacteristic nursing behaviour in pinnipeds, a mother-son relationship between the interacting pair was considered to be the most likely explanation.

AB The first documented recapture of a South African-tagged juvenile blue shark Prionace glauca off Uruguay lends weight to the hypothesis of a single blue shark population in the South Atlantic. The presence of neonate blue sharks with umbilical scars and females with post-parturition scars, as well as the high frequency of small juveniles in research longline catches, confirm the existence of a parturition and nursery area off South Africa. The final positions of three tagged sharks suggest that large-scale movement patterns in the South Atlantic are a mirror image of movements in the North Atlantic, with sharks using the north-westerly Benguela Drift to migrate into the tropics and ultimately across into South American waters. The confirmed existence of a parturition and nursery area off the south coast of South Africa and the movement of sharks into both adjacent ocean basins suggest that the southern African blue sharks are part of a single stock that straddles the South Atlantic and Indian oceans, and possibly the entire Southern Hemisphere.

AB The relative benefit of different grazing management practices for maintaining grassland biodiversity integrity was assessed. Practices considered were grazing system, stocking rate, animal type, grazing season, fire-grazing interaction, plus burning regime. Sparse empirical data indicated that stocking rate, cattle-to-sheep ratio, and increased fire intervals can affect plant diversity. Certain species behave as increaser or decreaser species in response to stocking rate or cattle-to-sheep ratio. Plant diversity appears robust in the face of variation in fire regime except for preclusion of fire. Multicriteria analysis was used to assess the relative impact of grazing systems (continuous, conventional, or high-intensity grazing by sheep, cattle, or sheep plus cattle) on grassland biodiversity integrity. Selected indicators covered landscape composition, structure and functioning. High-intensity systems and continuous sheep grazing have the most, and continuous grazing with beef the least, negative impact, depending on stocking rate. The relation between veld condition and plant diversity needs to be tested further before veld condition is used as a management tool for maintaining biodiversity. Proposed research priorities include inventory of management systems used, rapid expansion of the empirical data base, an improved understanding of patterns of plant diversity across the biome, and evaluation of the pyro-grazing diversity paradigm.

AB Seed ecology may play a role in the widespread increase of Acacia karroo in savanna and grassland. Accordingly, fecundity, predation, mortality by fire, dispersal by livestock, and seed longevity were studied. Seed production per tree (P of pod production, pods per tree) was positively related to tree height, negatively related to tree density, and was greater for sites receiving run-on. Predispersal predation by bruchids, cerambycids, and wasps depleted seed production by 18%. The ant Messor capensis effectively eliminated surface seed except during the early dry season following seed shed. Rodent predation of seed was minimal. Fires 100 degrees C killed most exposed seed but a thin layer of soil increased survival and maintained germinability. A greater proportion of ingested seeds passed through cattle (57%) and sheep (50%) than through goats (15%). 50% of seeds were recovered within 48 h. During passage, soft seeds were digested, some hard seeds were softened, but most were egested as hard seeds; germinability was not increased. Cattle were confirmed as dispersal agents. Using experimental seed banks, it was shown that buried or surface-exposed seeds did not persist for longer than a year, but 24% of surface-shaded seeds persisted for two years. Most seeds germinated but most buried seeds died before emergence. Seed persistence in deep shade should facilitate invasion into grassland. Seed banks of. A. karroo did not exceed 18 seeds m-2 because of the above-described effects. Seed availability (fecundity, dispersal by cattle, seed longevity) is concluded to contribute to the invasiveness of A. karroo, but use of fire may offer partial control of seed availability.

AB To proffer a sustainable solution to rangeland degradation, an understanding of the innate soil properties is vital. This study investigated the relative association of surface (0-20 cm) soil physicochemical properties, viz. electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, particle size composition, soil aggregate stability and microbial respiration, along a toposequence in two vegetation types. The study sites and vegetation types were Magwiji (Lesotho Highland Basalt Grassland) and Upper Mnxe (Tsomo Grassland). In each site, we identified three experimental units along toposequence delineation, classified as crest, midslope and valley bottom. Vegetation type significantly (p 0.05) affected sand fraction, aggregate stability under fast wetting, and mechanical disaggregation and CEC. Toposequence delineation significantly (p 0.05) affected fast wetting, slow wetting, mechanical disaggregation, microbial respiration and CEC. There was significant variation and relationship between vegetation types, toposequence delineation and soil properties. The results suggest that toposequence delineation more than vegetation type influences soil property rangelands; therefore, in determining site-specific management techniques for communal rangelands it is important to consider the direction and magnitude of these relationships.

ID CONTACT-DERMATITIS; EASTERN ETHIOPIA
AB We carried out a trial in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park comparing three herbicides and two manual control techniques for controlling the annual weed Parthenium hysterophorus L. The herbicides 2,4-D amine (480 g ai l-1), metsulfuron methyl (600 g kg-1) and picloram (240 g l-1) were tested at three levels each. Manual control comprised hoeing and pulling out parthenium plants by hand. Treatments were applied in mid-December 2006. Surveys were conducted prior to treatment and again in March 2007. The untreated control had a mean mortality of 16% at the end of the growing season, attributed to self thinning. Parthenium mortalities above 80% were achieved with metsulfuron methyl 18-75 g ai ha-1, picloram 270-360 g ai ha-1 and both manual control techniques. Broadleaf species, 10 out of 15 of which were alien, were severely affected by herbicides but alien forbs appeared to benefit by the selective removal of parthenium in the manual control treatments. Native grasses filled the space vacated by broadleaf species in the plots treated with herbicide. However, none of the treatments offered lasting control because parthenium regeneration density a year later was no different to densities at the start of the trial. Successful management of parthenium rests on a strong commitment to follow-up spraying until alternative vegetation has covered and stabilised areas under treatment.

DE Bush encroachment; tree density; tree succession
AB The long-term establishment sequence of the woody component of the Sourish Mixed Bushveld of the Limpopo province was studied and documented. Vegetation surveys were conducted at a protected site at the Towoomba Agricultural Development Centre during 1977 and 2000. Over the 23-year period, bush density at the site increased by 33%. Changes in the woody component indicated a shift from an acacia-dominated site to one dominated by broadleaved tree species. Early colonisers included mostly Acacia species (A. karroo, A. robusta, A. nilotica, A. gerrardii, A. tortilis, A. caffra, A. habeclada and A. mellifera), Dichrostachys cinerea and a few broadleaved species (Ximenia caffra, Dombeya rotundifolia and Searsia spp.). Intermediate colonisers included various shrubs (Diospyros lycioides, the Maytenus/Gymnosporia species group, Euclea species, Carissa bispinosa and Grewia spp.), a limited number of tree species (Pappea capensis, Boscia albitrunca and Ziziphus mucronata) and only two legumes (A. robusta and Peltophorum africanum). Late colonisers included only broadleaved shrubs and Waterberg Mountain Sourveld tree species (Grewia flavescens, Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Berchemia zeyerii, Cassine transvaalensis, Schotia brachypetala, Ximenia caffra, Heteropyxis natalensis, Terminalia sericea, Vangueria infausta and Searsia lancea). The leguminous and broadleaved components appeared to have distinct establishment sequences. Acacia spp. appeared to facilitate the early invasion of broadleaved woody species.

AB The Great Fish River Reserve (GFRR), in the Eastern Cape, has proved to be particularly suitable for the black rhinoceros that have been introduced over the past 20 years. In captivity, these animals often suffer from a number of disease conditions, certain of which may be related to antioxidant deficiencies in their diet. Therefore, the antioxidant capacities of the leaves of 25 bush species in the GFRR was determined by the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods and the total phenolics by the Folin-Ciocalteau procedure. The plant species Ozoroa mucronata, Putterlickia pyracantha, Phyllanthus verrucosus, Maytenus capitata, Euclea undulata and Jatropha capensis were found to have the highest antioxidant capacity by the three methods, whereas for total phenols Putterlickia pyracantha was replaced in the top six by Carissa bispinosa. The black rhinoceros in this area appear to favour plants of varying antioxidant capacity and do not seem to select browse species for this property.

AB Fifteen plant species were collected from the Nelspruit Botanical Garden based on a list of plants provided by Phytomedicine Programme at the University of Pretoria and their ethnopharmacological information. Hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), acetone and methanolic extracts were screened for antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis. The acetone extract of Milletia stulhimannii was the most active, showing activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.13 mg/ml. Acetone extracts for all plants had lower MIC values ranging between 0.11-1.25 mg/ml against M. smegmatis. Milletia stulhimannii, Albizia gummifera, Xanthocercis zambesiaca and Barringtonia racemosa have shown great potential as anti-tuberculosis agents. They were active against M. smegmatis with average MIC values of acetone extracts of 0.13 mg/ml.

AB The effect of administration of aqueous extract of Hippobromus pauciflorus (L.f.) Radlk (Sapindaceae) leaves at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight for 14 days on some biochemical parameters in male Wistar rats was investigated. The extract at all the doses tested did not significantly (P>0.05) alter the levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and large unstained cells. While the levels of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and basophils increased significantly (P<0.05) at specific doses, the mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and eosinophils decreased significantly (P<0.05). Again, the extract did not significantly (P<0.05) alter the computed liver-and kidney-body weight ratios, sodium, chloride and total protein, though, the levels of potassium, inorganic phosphorus, globulin, urea, total and conjugated bilirubin increased significantly (P<0.05) at certain doses. In contrast, the levels of albumin and creatinine also decreased significantly (P<0.05) at specific doses. While the activities of alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase remained significantly (P<0.05) unaltered in the serum, aspartate aminotransferase activity increased only at 200 mg/kg body weight. The atherogenic index as well as the concentrations of cholesterol, high-and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the serum of the animals were not significantly (P>0.05) altered. However, the extract significantly (P<0.05) increased the concentration of triacylglycerol. The results suggest that the extract has mild and dose specific haemato-, hepato- and nephrotoxic effects and may not be completely safe as oral remedy at the doses investigated.

AB The hexane, acetone, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of Combretum vendae A.E. van Wyk (Combretaceae), Commiphora harveyi (Engl.) Engl. (Burseraceae), Khaya anthotheca (Welm.) C. DC (Meliaceae), Kirkia wilmsii Engl. (Kirkiaceae), Loxostylis alata A. Spreng. ex Rchb. (Anacardiaceae), Ochna natalitia (Meisn.) Walp. (Ochnaceae) and Protorhus longifolia (Bernh. Ex C. Krauss) Engl. (Anacardiaceae) were screened for their antimicrobial activity. The test organisms included bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Microsporum canis and Sporothrix schenckii). A simple bioautographic procedure, involving spraying suspensions of the bacteria or fungi on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates developed in solvents of varying polarities was used to detect the number of antibacterial and antifungal compounds present in the extracts. All the extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. This activity was denoted by white spots against a red-purple background on the TLC plates after spraying with tetrazolium violet. Twenty seven TLC plates; 9 for each solvent system and 3 different solvent systems per organism were tested in the bioautographic procedure. Of the bacteria tested, S. aureus was inhibited by the most compounds separated on the TLC plates from all the tested plants. Similarly, growth of the fungus C. neoformans was also inhibited by many compounds present in the extracts. Loxostylis alata appeared to be the plant extract with the highest number of inhibition bands when compared with other plants tested against both bacteria and fungi. This species was selected for in depth further study.

AB The antibacterial activities of three Croton species were compared using bioautography and the serial microdilution methods. The methanolic extracts of all the species had low activity against Escherichia coli. The highest activity was observed with Croton megalobotrys against Enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.02 mg/ml. Croton steenkapianus extracts were the least active of the species investigated, only managing an MIC value of 0.625 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Croton megalobotrys leaf powder was serially extracted using solvents of various polarities. The lowest MIC value (0.06 mg/ml) of the serially extracted fractions was observed with acetone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The liquid-liquid fractions of the methanol extract of Croton megalobotrys were also tested. The lowest MIC value of 0.02 mg/ml was observed with n-hexane fraction against Enterococcus faecalis. The carbon tetrachloride fraction was further fractionated using column chromatography with silica as the immobile phase. The resulting seven fractions were tested for activity following the bioassay-guided practice, and it emerged that the first three fractions had active compounds against Staphylococcus aureus when the bioautography method was used.

AB Adherence to antiretroviral medication in the treatment of HIV is critical, both to maximize efficacy and to minimize the emergence of drug resistance. The aim of this prospective study in three public hospitals in KwaZuluNatal, South Africa, is to assess the use of Traditional Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM) by HIV patients and its effect on antiretroviral (ARV) adherence 6 months after initiating ARVs. 735 (29.8% male and 70.2% female) patients who consecutively attended three HIV clinics completed assessments prior to ARV initiation and 519 after six months on antiretroviral therapy (ART) Results indicate that the use of herbal therapies for HIV declined significantly from 36.6% prior to antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation to 7.9% after being on ARVs for 6 months. Faith healing methods, including spiritual practices and prayer for HIV declined from 35.8% to 22.1% and physical/body-mind therapy (exercise and massage) declined from 5.0% to 1.9%. In contrast, the use of micronutrients (vitamins, etc.) significantly increased from 42.6% to 87.4%. In multivariate regression analyses, ARV non-adherence (dose, schedule and food) was associated with the use of herbal treatment, not taking micronutrients and the use of over-the-counter drugs. The use of TCAM declined after initiating ARVs. As herbal treatment for HIV was associated with reduced ARV adherence, patients' use of TCAM should be considered in ARV adherence management.

AB Senna italica, a member of the Fabaceae family (subfamily Caesalpinaceae), is widely used traditionally to treat a number of disease conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases and some forms of intestinal complications. The roots of Senna italica were collected from Zebediela subregion, Limpopo province (S. A), powdered and extracted with acetone by cold/shaking extraction method. The phytochemical composition of the extract was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The chromatograms were visualised with vanillin-sulphuric acid and p-anisaldehyde reagents. The total phenolic content of the extract was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as TAE/g dry weight. The extract was assayed for the in vitro anticancer activity using Jurkat T cells, antioxidant activity using DPPH assay and antibacterial activity by bioautographic method and the microtitre plate method. The acetone extract of the roots of Senna italica inhibited the growth of Jurkat T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The extract also had free radical scavenging activity as well as reasonable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs ranging from 0,08 to 0.16 mg/ml in the same order as ampicillin the positive control. The biological activities observed in the acetone extract validated the ethnomedicinal use of Senna italica.

ID EASTERN CAPE; HIV
AB The aim of this study was to assess the safety of traditional male circumcision practices among Ndebele traditional surgeons following a five days training by direct observation of circumcision procedures. The sample included eight Ndebele traditional surgeons and traditional nurses and 86 initiates (abakhwetwa) from two districts in Gauteng province in South Africa. A structured observations tool was administered by a trained research doctor during circumcisions and (wound) care of the initiates of the trained traditional surgeons. Results indicate that from the observations of 86 traditional male circumcisions a high number (37%) of adverse events were recorded (excessive bleeding, excessive skin removed and damage to the penis) and in six cases the use of one instrument for the circumcision was observed. Before scaling up and/or considering integration traditional male circumcision services into medical male circumcision services in South Africa, a careful strategy to minimize unnecessary morbidity, and fundamental improvements on current traditional male circumcision techniques, are required. In addition, legislation and control of traditional male circumcision in Gauteng province, where the study took place, are recommended to make traditional male circumcision safer and to prevent adverse events to happen.

AB The aim of this study was to determine BHPs' views on collaboration with THPs in Tutume sub district, identify collaboration activities that have been going on and determine approaches to collaboration that are acceptable to BHPs. A cross sectional survey was conducted with a convenient sample of 60 biomedicine health practitioners. The sample was drawn from two primary hospitals and clinics in Tutume Sub-District, Botswana. A pre-tested self administered questionnaire with open- and closed ended questions was used to obtain information. Majority of BHPs were in favour of collaboration despite the low levels of collaboration with THPs and low levels of awareness of the policy on collaboration. Patient referral was the preferred approach to collaboration but majority of BHPs would not refer patients to THPs. Despite the fact that BHPs were not familiar with most traditional practices they were of the opinion that they will not learn anything from THPs but were favourable towards exchange of information and biomedical skills. We conclude that BHPs were not ready to collaborate with THPs in HIV and AIDS care. BHPs wanted collaboration to be on their terms i.e. they prefer the collaboration to be limited to one way referrals from TPHs to BHPs, they will teach THPs but they were not willing to learn from them and they had negative opinions of the traditional health practice. Therefore, lack of specific guidelines on collaboration negatively affected collaborative efforts in the sub-district.

AB Ethnomedicine has gained a lot of recognition in post-independence Zimbabwe and yet little research on anti-fertility medicines has been done. Information on plants used as anti-fertility medicines was obtained by interviewing women, men, traditional healers and traditional midwives in urban Harare and surrounding rural areas of Mvurwi, Seke and Chiweshe. The use of 31 species belonging to 17 families for antifertility purposes is described. This survey forms a basis to initiate a study into the efficacy and toxicology of plants used by Zimbabwean women as traditional anti-fertility medicines.

AB Felicia muricata is a medicinal plant used for the management of different human and livestock diseases in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The antioxidant potential of the leaves from this herb was investigated using its water, methanol, acetone and ethanol extracts. All the extracts were rich in phenols, proanthocyanidins and flavonols but low in flavonoids. The water extract exhibited low DPPH scavenging activity while the methanol, acetone and ethanol extracts showed higher activities. Again all the extracts showed high ABTS scavenging activity with a correlation between total phenolic content (R(2) = 0.9965), DPPH (R(2) = 0.982) and ABTS (R(2) = 0.927). Traditionally, however, plant extracts are prepared with water as infusions, decoction and poultice. Our results have shown that both the water and ethanol extracts from Felicia muricata displayed strong antioxidant activity. Therefore, it would seem likely that both solvents were able to extract those compounds which are responsible for the antioxidant activity of F. muricata.

DE History Workshop (HW); social history
AB This article is a brief reflection on the History Workshop (HW)'s intellectual repertoire through the rubric of 'social history' - one that is widely associated with the Workshop's major innovations and accomplishments, even if it does not exhaustively capture its project and product over thirty years. Writing as an active member of the HW for thirteen years, the article is, in many ways, a tribute to the Workshop's intellectual vitality - which enriched my academic life. It is also a friendly challenge to the current HW to grapple more explicitly with the current character and place of social history in its oevre - an undertaking that would prompt a more theoretically reflexive turn than has been the Workshop's predilection for much of its past.

DE local history; social history; space; place; township; location
AB This article discusses the evolution of the History Workshop (HW)'s engagement with local history from the late 1970s to the present. It reflects on the articulation between local history and social history, which collectively defined much of the HW's theory and practice. The proliferation in local histories was associated in the 1980s with the mounting anti-apartheid movement, especially in black working-class localities, which augmented the emancipatory impulses in the production of this kind of history. Although the triennial HW conferences during this period debated important questions related to the character of local communities and the contested meanings of 'the local', it is argued here that the HW did not systematically engage the emerging theoretical discussions on the production of space and place. Consequently, histories of 'the local' largely did not give appropriate attention to the importance of place. The final part of this article suggests that the resurgence in local history over the past few years, which has arguably been inspired by global and local protest movements, offers the HW an opportunity seriously to address theoretical questions about space, place and the local.

AB This article is a reflection of the trajectory of heritage or public history since the path breaking History Workshop conference titled 'Myths, Monuments, Museums: New Premises?' The article briefly revisits some of the arguments made at the 1992 conference, particularly those that related to the fate of heritage representations crafted during apartheid. The Voortrekker Monument provides a path into discussion about the possibilities opened after 1994 for transformation of old heritage sites and the ways in which such sites have been reappropriated by new hegemonic political discourse, which has some disturbing resemblances to the old one.

AB This article examines the ways in which the disciplines of history and archaeology in South Africa relate and how they have negotiated the public as part of their disciplinary practices of producing knowledge about the past that is accessible. It presents an analysis of questions of knowledge and power, and the different ways that scholars working broadly as 'historians' or 'archaeologists' have viewed the relationship between expertise and 'community'. It is also about how relations of expertise have been negotiated within and across these fields, and particularly how those relations of expertise have been contested. This is done through an analysis of the varied social history research and efforts at popularisation of the History Workshop at the University of the Witwatersrand, as well as the forms of public engagement on the part of public archaeologists in the District Six Museum and in Khoisan rock art research. The article also analyses the District Six Museum in Cape Town as a space of emerging expertise in the field of public history, whose practice and experience demonstrates the possibilities and limits of transcending relations of knowledge characterised by a politics of paternalism and atonement, in which public scholarship is limited to relations of outreach. The article is concerned to understand the possibilities of decentring and relocating expertise outside the academy.

AB Besides its pioneering scholarship on the social histories of the marginalised and oppressed communities in South Africa, the History Workshop (HW) at the University of the Witwatersrand has also made an immense contribution to the teaching of history in secondary school through its teachers' workshops. Its input in the realm of teacher development has been quite remarkable in the context of the changing curriculum and educational policy more generally since the 1990s an aspect of the HW's intellectual project that has received limited scholarly attention. After the introduction of the new curriculum, oral history was placed at the centre of the history syllabus from the early 2000s. However, the curriculum gave no concrete guidelines on how to deal with the complexities of oral history or other new components of the syllabus. Furthermore, no provision had been made for the retraining of the teachers, who were mostly left to their own devices. The HW with its many years of oral history experience partially filled the vacuum. It resuscitated its annual teachers' workshops and provided the most critical support of introducing oral history to the educators, exploring its strengths and weaknesses, as well as showing how this could be beneficial in the classroom. This article reflects critically on the experiences of the HW on the issue of oral history in the schools mainly in Mpumalanga (but also in other provinces) between 2002 and 2009 - experiences that showed a mixture of possibilities and challenges.

AB Stonewalls connect over 10,000 square kilometres of the Mpumalanga highveld into a complex web of homesteads, towns, terraces and roads, that stretches for 150 kilometres in an almost continuous belt. They suggest a substantial population, and speak to the investment of vast amounts of labour in infrastructural development along with extraordinary levels of agricultural innovation and productivity. This network of stone embodies Bokoni, the pre-nineteenth century home of people from a range of origins who practiced distinctive forms of agriculture (Maggs 2008) and participated in regional and international trade (Delius and Schoeman 2008). Yet, the academic gaze seldom rested long on these extraordinary archaeological/historical sites, hence thin archaeological accounts are supplemented by even thinner historical accounts. Whilst archaeologists and historians largely ignored Bokoni, exotic accounts have proliferated. In this article we explore why so little academic research has focused on Bokoni and why exotic accounts became so dominant.

AB The concept of 'landscape historical ecology' has been adopted by many researchers across the spectrum of earth sciences, social sciences and humanities in recent decades as a means of offering both conceptual and practical tools for joining very different kinds of information into an assessment of human-environment interaction. The aims of this article are to outline the analytical potential of adopting the key precepts of historical ecology for the interpretation of the archaeological and historical signatures of the last 500 years of human settlement in eastern Africa, and to describe ongoing research being undertaken as part of the HEEAL project, with particular reference to the ecological and other transformations initiated following intensification of the ivory trade. The concluding section discusses the relevance of adopting similar approaches to the investigation of different southern African landscapes within the context of the FYI project.

AB This article considers what Geoff Blundell has called the 'Holy Grail of southern African rock art research' (2004:63): the vision of a South African history, based not on outsider colonial records, but on the insider evidence of rock art. It reviews two decades of research aimed at historicising our understanding of the rock art of the Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains and discusses the extent to which this work has provided the kind of histories 'owned by the San' that were called for by Aron Mazel in 1992 (see quote below). Has this work sought the unattainable, a Holy Grail, or does it open the door to more inclusive writings on the past?.

AB Investigation of the history of states and societies in South Africa prior to the seventeenth century has been impeded by the different pathways of research pursued by historians and archaeologists since the late 1970s. While precolonial historical research remained unconsciously in thrall to a short chronology for the establishment of Iron-Age societies south of the Limpopo and concentrated on developments in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, archaeologists employed radiocarbon dating to push the chronology of Iron-Age settlement back to the early centuries of the present era. These implications of the longer chronology for precolonial history have yet to be fully explored. By abandoning the hypothesis that the notable kingdoms, which rose to prominence at the turn of the nineteenth century, embodied novel constitutional principles and statecraft, historians may assist in the interpretation of archaeological sites dating from earlier centuries.

AB The formation of South African citizenship between 1897 and 1937 may be explained through the process of bureaucratic regulation of the mobility of three populations: European, African, and Asian. The origins of South African laws of immigration and nationality are found in this period. Identifying first the baseline concept of South African citizenship, this article describes and analyses three manifestations of current ferment regarding such citizenship. In each of the branches of government, there is contestation regarding the currently dominant vision of South African citizenship. Most prominently, there is a contest between official residence citizenship and republication citizenship in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court. In conclusion, the article explores the potential for further movement towards denizenship within the South African migration regime.

AB This article traces racial identification and identity formation within the 'coloured communities' of Stellenbosch (c. 1890 - 1960) and discusses how this process was, and still is, affected by political, social and economic pressures on a macro (state), meso (municipal) and micro (individual) level. In re-imagining and re-interpreting a select past, a particular identity somehow becomes assumed and mythologised to such an extent that the diversity within is relegated to the periphery. It will be suggested that becoming merely 'a coloured' from Stellenbosch rather than part of 'the coloured community' will give rise to a fair evaluation of the past, an objective legacy for generations to come and the freedom to celebrate the diversity that exists within.

AB Durban has embarked on an ambitious programme to re-make the city into a preferred destination for mega-sports events. In order to achieve this it has earmarked the area closest to the central beachfront to build sporting facilities and related infrastructure. This article looks at the consequences of this re-making by focusing on how the poor in the inner city have been affected. The article concentrates on two areas - Albert Park where African immigrants reside and Warwick Junction, the site of a century-old market. It shows that rather than the city having been re-made from the top, it has had to contend with resistance from below. The article concludes by raising some important theoretical concerns in comprehending the major changes unfolding in post-apartheid cities like Durban.

TI Subaltern Sexiness: From a Politics of Representation to a Politics of
   Difference
SO AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Representation; social movements; World Social Forum; politics
AB Through personal experience of the World Social Forum (WSF) held in Nairobi, Kenya in 2007, the author explores how an uncritical politics of representation has come to characterise spaces like the WSF and the new social movements and organisations of which it is composed and spaces that claim to be creating 'another world' in which racial, gender and class inequalities do not prevail. The article argues that, in neglecting to acknowledge the mediation of subaltern voices by middle-class activists, academics, researchers, NGO-workers, and so on, claims to 'give voice' to those who traditionally have been denied access to forms and modes of representation common to politics in capitalist society tend to reinforce inequalities as they deny the existence of difference amongst activists. For those writing about social movements, the article suggests that greater attention be given to what the structures of representation in society prevent the subaltern from saying, and to try to understand the logics and rationalities particular to different groups and communities of political actors.

ID IDENTITIES
AB This article explores existing boundaries and borders, both real and metaphorical, related to various Chinese communities in southern Africa. Starting with a discussion of the physical, territorial and often quite porous borders between South Africa and its neighbouring countries, Park then turns to the metaphorical, fluid, and constructed boundaries between various groups of Chinese, between citizen and foreigner, and between settler and sojourner. The article concludes with the suggestion that while China and South Africa do not share a physical boundary, the concept of borderlands and borderland identities might be useful in explaining the transitional, unstable, and fluid nature of these groups of Chinese (and those with whom they interact) at a time when both countries are witnessing tremendous changes.

DT Article
DE Lusoga; Bantu; noun class system; corpus linguistics; semantics
ID DICTIONARY
AB In this article it is shown how distributional corpus analysis may be used to start the description of a (mostly) undocumented language. The approach is illustrated for Lusoga (JE16), an eastern interlacustrine Bantu language spoken in and around Jinja, Uganda. The topic is the noun in Lusoga, with three levels receiving particular attention: the morphological, morphophonological and semantic.
   In a first section we show that a relative distribution of the type and token counts for each noun class in combination with a weighted two-dimensional noun class system is a most powerful way to visualize the strength of each node and each link in the structure. In a second section we proceed with an indication of how a quantified enumeration of both nominal morphophonology and noun constructions cum linked meanings provides for a representative picture of the various noun-building issues. In a third and final section, we then argue in favour of a three-dimensional semantic-import view of nouns, with as axes noun classes, semantic categories, and corpus frequencies.' This is not only a novel but also a most revealing and promising avenue to decode the underlying semantic system of the noun in Lusoga, as well as the noun in any other Bantu language.

AB We propose a formalism for reasoning about actions based on multi-modal logic which allows for expressing observations as first-class objects. We introduce a new modal operator, namely [o vertical bar alpha], which allows us to capture the notion of perceiving an observation given that an action has taken place. Formulae of the type [o vertical bar alpha] phi mean 'after perceiving observation o, given alpha was performed, necessarily phi'. In this paper, we focus on the challenges concerning sensing with explicit observations, and acting with nondeterministic effects. We present the syntax and semantics, and a correct and decidable tableau calculus for the logic.

AB Objectives: In the absence of HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif), cellular cytosine deaminases such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) inhibit the virus by inducing hypermutations on viral DNA, among other mechanisms of action. We investigated the association of APOBEC3G mRNA levels and genetic variants on HIV-1 susceptibility, and early disease pathogenesis using viral load and CD4(+) T-cell counts as outcomes.
   Methods: Study participants were 250 South African women at high risk for HIV-1 subtype C infection. We used real-time PCR to measure the expression of APOBEC3C in HIV-negative and HIV-positive primary infection samples. APOBEC3C variants were identified by DNA re-sequencing and TaqMan genotyping.
   Results: We found no correlation between APOBEC3C expression levels and plasma viral loads (r=0.053, P=0.596) or CD4(+) T-cell counts (r=0.030, P=0.762) in 32 seroconverters. APOBEC3C expression levels were higher in HIV-negative individuals as compared with HIV-positive individuals (P<0.0001), including matched pre and postinfection samples from the same individuals (n=13, P<0.0001). Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms, including eight novel, were identified within APOBEC3C by re-sequencing and genotyping. The H186R mutation, a codon-changing variant in exon 4, and a 3' extragenic Mutation (rs35228531) were associated with high viral loads (P=0.0097 and P < 0.0001) and decreased CD4(+) T-cell levels (P=0.0081 and P < 0.0001), respectively.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that APOBEC3C transcription is rapidly downregulated upon HIV-1 infection. During primary infection, APOBEC3C expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells do not correlate with viral loads or CD4(+) T-cell counts. Genetic variation of APOBEC3G may significantly affect early HIV-11 pathogenesis, although the mechanism remains unclear and warrants further investigation.

AB Objectives: To determine the prevalence and type of birth defects among infants following exposure to efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (EFV-based ART) during pregnancy.
   Methods: A Pregnancy Registry was established to enable prospective follow-up of women taking EFV-based ART. In women who conceived on EFV-based ART, EFV was switched with another drug if they presented during the first trimester but was continued if they presented at or after 14 weeks' gestation. Pregnant women needing lifelong ART were commenced on EFV-based ART from 14 weeks' gestation onwards. Infants were followed up for 6 weeks after birth.
   Results: Between January 2006 and December 2008, 623 ART-naive pregnant women initiated EFV-based ART in the second/third trimester and 195 women conceived on EFV-based ART. Birth defects were observed in 16 of 623 live births [2.60%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.5-4.2] and in six of 184 live births (3.3%; 95% Cl 1.2-7.0) from women exposed to EFV in the second/third trimester and first trimester, respectively. The prevalence of birth defects was not significantly different between the first and second/third trimester EFV exposure (prevalence ratio 1.27; 95% Cl 0.50-3.20; P=0.301).
   Conclusion: No significant increase in the prevalence of birth defects following exposure to EFV-based ART in the first trimester was observed in this cohort. However, the limited number of first trimester EFV-exposed infants precludes definitive conclusions on the teratogenicity or safety of EFV.

AB Objective: To evaluate rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation within 12 months of a new HIV diagnosis in Durban, South Africa. Design: Prospective observational cohort.
   Methods: Adults (>= 18 years) were enrolled before HIV testing at two outpatient clinics into the South African Test, Identify and Link cohort. Both sites offer comprehensive HIV care. HIV test results, CD4 cell counts, dates of ART initiation and dates of death were collected from medical records and 12-month patient/family interviews were conducted. ART eligibility was defined as a CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mu l within 90 days of HIV diagnosis. The primary endpoint was ART initiation within 12 months for ART-eligible subjects.
   Results: From November 2006 to October 2008, 1474 newly diagnosed HIV-infected outpatients were enrolled, 1012 (691%) of whom underwent CD4 cell count testing within 90 days. The median CD4 cell count was 159 cells/mu l (interquartile range 65299). Of those who underwent CD4 cell count testing, 538 (53%) were ART-eligible. Only 210 (39%) eligible enrollees were known to have initiated ART within 12 months. Among ART-eligible subjects, there were 108 known deaths; 82% occurred before ART initiation or with unknown ART initiation status. Men rate ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.51 and subjects without an HIV-infected family member/friend (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) were more likely not to start ART.
   Conclusion: Less than half of ART-eligible subjects started ART within 12 months. Substantial attrition and mortality follow HIV diagnosis before ART initiation in Durban, South Africa. Major efforts directed towards earlier HIV diagnosis, effective linkage to care and timely ART initiation are urgently needed.

AB In countries severely affected by HIV/AIDS, shortages of health workers present a major obstacle to scaling up HIV services. Adopting a task shifting approach for the deployment of community health workers (CHWs) represents one strategy for rapid expansion of the health workforce. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of CHWs with a focus on identifying the critical elements of an enabling environment that can ensure they provide quality services in a manner that is sustainable.
   The method of work included a collection of primary data in five countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, Malawi, Namibia, and Uganda.
   The findings show that delegation of specific tasks to cadres of CHWs with limited training can increase access to HIV services, particularly in rural areas and among underserved communities, and can improve the quality of care for HIV. There is also evidence that CHWs can make a significant contribution to the delivery of a wide range of other health services. The findings also show that certain conditions must be observed if CHWs are to contribute to well-functioning and sustainable service delivery. These conditions involve adequate systems integration with significant attention to: political will and commitment; collaborative planning; definition of scope of practice; selection and educational requirements; registration, licensure and certification; recruitment and deployment; adequate and sustainable remuneration; mentoring and supervision including referral system; career path and continuous education; performance evaluation; supply of equipment and commodities.
   The study concludes that, where there is the necessary support, the potential contribution of CHWs can be optimized and represents a valuable addition to the urgent expansion of human resources for health, and to universal coverage of HIV services.

AB While many AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa are receiving antiretroviral treatment ( ART) via public clinics, improvements in health status also depend on socioeconomic and psychological factors and quality of healthcare services. Inter-dependence between patients' clinical markers and quality of life indicators should be analyzed using comprehensive models. This longitudinal study compiled socioeconomic and clinical variables at six monthly intervals on patients receiving ART in South Africa; patients' ratings of quality of services and staff in "Assessment" and "Treatment" sites were assessed. Dynamic random effects models were estimated by maximum likelihood for CD4 cell counts and for quality of life indices (EQ-5D and Visual Analogue Scale), incorporating the inter-dependence between plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. The results showed that emotional support received by patients was a significant predictor (P<0.05) of CD4 cell counts and quality of life indices. Ratings of services and staff in Assessment and Treatment sites were significantly associated with CD4 cell counts and quality of life indices; CD4 cell count was a significant predictor of quality of life indices. The results indicated that it is important to compile socioeconomic and psychological variables for AIDS patients and monitor healthcare services for improving their health status and quality of life.

TI Orphans of the AIDS epidemic? The extent, nature and circumstances of

AB There is widespread concern that the number of children living in "child-headed households" is rapidly increasing as a result of AIDS-related adult mortality in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Based on analyses of data from several representative national surveys over the period 2000-2007, this paper examines the extent to which this is the case in South Africa. It explores trends in the number of children living in child-only households and characterises these children relative to children living in households with adults (mixed-generation households). The findings indicate that the proportion of child-only households is relatively small (0.47% in 2006) and does not appear to be increasing. In addition, the vast majority (92.1%) of children resident in child-only households have a living parent. The findings raise critical questions about the circumstances leading to the formation of child-only households and highlight that they cannot for the main part be ascribed to HIV orphaning. Nonetheless, the number of children living in this household form is not insignificant, and their circumstances, when compared with children in mixed-generation households, indicate a range of challenges, including greater economic vulnerability and inadequate service access. We argue that a solitary focus on the HIV epidemic and its related orphaning as the cause of child-only households masks other important issues for consideration in addressing their needs, and risks the development of inappropriate policies, programmes and interventions.

AB The vulnerabilities that underlie barriers faced by the rural poor whilst trying to access and adhere to "free'' antiretroviral treatment (ART) demand more attention. This paper highlights barriers that poor rural Zambians co-infected with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV and their households faced in accessing ART between September 2006 and July 2007, and accounts for patient outcomes by the end of TB treatment and (more sporadically) beyond October 2009. The analysis draws on findings from wider anthropological fieldwork on the converging impact of TB, HIV and food insecurity, focusing for the purpose of this paper on ethnographic case-studies of seven newly diagnosed TB patients co-infected with HIV and their six households (one household had two TB patients). Economic barriers included being pushed into deeper poverty by managing TB, rural location, absence of any external assistance, and mustering time and extended funds for transport and "special food'' during and beyond the end of TB. In the case of death, funeral costs were astronomical. Social barriers included translocation, broken marriages, a sub-ordinate household position, gender relations, denial, TB/HIV stigma and the difficulty of disclosure. Health facility barriers involved understaffing, many steps, lengthy procedures and inefficiencies (lost blood samples, electricity cuts). By the end of TB treatment, outcomes were mixed; two co-infected patients had died, three had started ART and two had yet to start ART. The three on ART underwent a striking transformation in the short term. By October 2009, two more had died and three were doing well. The study advocates nutritional support and other material support (especially transport funds) for co-infected TB patients until ART is accessed and livelihood regained. More prompt diagnosis of TB and reducing steps and increasing the reach of the ART programme in rural areas are also recommended.

AB One of the consequences of massive investment in antiretroviral access and other AIDS programmes has been the rapid emergence of large numbers of lay workers in the health systems of developing countries. In South Africa, government estimates are 65,000, mostly HIV/TB care-related lay workers contribute their labour in the public health sector, outnumbering the main front-line primary health care providers and professional nurses. The phenomenon has grown organically and incrementally, playing a wide variety of care-giving, support and advocacy roles. Using South Africa as a case, this paper discusses the different forms, traditions and contradictory orientations taken by lay health work and the system-wide effects of a large lay worker presence. As pressures to regularise and formalise the status of lay health workers grow, important questions are raised as to their place in health systems, and more broadly what they represent as a new intermediary layer between state and citizen. It argues for a research agenda that seeks to better characterise types of lay involvement in the health system, particularly in an era of antiretroviral therapy, and which takes a wider perspective on the meanings of this recent re-emergence of an old concept in health systems heavily affected by HIV/AIDS.

AB This study explores the effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes on health-care human resources in South Africa. The study included two parts, a questionnaire-based survey of 269 health workers published earlier and a qualitative study of 21 purposively selected health practitioners involved in ART scale up. Contrary to what has been presented in literature, our survey showed that health workers in ART programmes experienced higher levels of morale, lower stress, lower sickness absenteeism and higher levels of job satisfaction. This paper uses qualitative data to provide insights into the working environment of ART workers and examines some possible explanations for our survey findings. The key factors that contribute to the different perception of working environment by ART workers identified in this study include bringing hope to patients, delaying deaths, acquiring training and the ability to better manage and monitor the disease.

AB Little systematic research has been conducted on the extent of psychiatric disorders among South African patients in general, and among patients living with HIV in particular. The present study reports on a survey conducted among 85 patients receiving treatment at three HIV clinics in the Western Cape. Participants completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), two self-report instruments designed to measure mood disturbance. The mean score of the sample on the HSCL was 47.54, which was significantly different from the commonly used cut-point of 44 for clinically significant distress; 52.9% of the sample scored in the elevated range on this measure. On the BDI, 37.6% of the sample fell in or above the moderate range for depression. The results suggest that a considerable proportion of the sample may be experiencing psychiatric difficulty, for which they may not be receiving treatment.

AB The effectiveness of modified-directly observed therapy (m-DOT), an adherence support intervention adapted from TB DOTS programmes, has been documented. Describing the implementation process and acceptability of this intervention is important for scaling up, replication in other settings and future research.
   In a randomised trial in Mombasa, Kenya, patients were assigned to m-DOT or standard of care for 24 weeks. m-DOT entailed twice weekly visits to a health centre for medication collection, ongoing adherence counselling and nurse-observed pill ingestion. Community health workers (CHWs) traced non-attendees, observing pill taking at participant's home. Using process indicators and a semi-structured questionnaire, implementation of m-DOT was evaluated among 94 participants who completed 24 weeks m-DOT (81%; 94/116).
   Two-thirds of m-DOT recipients were female (64%; 74/116) and a mean 37 years (SD = 7.8). Selection of the m-DOT observation site was determined by proximity to home for 73% (69/94), with the remainder choosing sites near their workplace, or due to perceived high-quality services. A median 42 of 48 scheduled m-DOT visits (IQR = 28-45) were attended. Most found m-DOT is very useful (87%; 82/94) and had positive attitudes to the services. A high proportion received CHWs home visits (96%; 90/94) and looked forward to these. Use of CHWs and several satellite observation sites facilitated provision of services closer to patient's homes. A substantial number, however, thought 24 weeks of m-DOT was too long (43%; 42/94).
   Our experience suggests that m-DOT services could be implemented widely and are acceptable if delivered with adequate attention to coordination, provision of a broad set of interventions, shifting tasks to less-specialised workers and integration within the health system. m-DOT programmes should utilise existing resources while simultaneously expanding capacity within communities and the public sector. These findings could be used to inform replication of such services and to improve the design of m-DOT in future studies.

AB Despite the seriousness of the HIV epidemic globally, and in South Africa in particular, little is known about how HIV/AIDS affects disabled people. One important and little explored area is the role that organisations that represent disabled people or that work on behalf of disabled people, are playing in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic among the disabled people they represent or serve. This paper presents the findings of a nationwide survey of disability organisations in South Africa. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of disability organisations in addressing the HIV epidemic among disabled people in South Africa. The findings suggest that while organisations recognise the importance of providing HIV education, and many have taken steps to do so, disabled people are largely excluded from general HIV prevention messages. Disabled people also have significant difficulties in accessing general health care, relevant for HIV testing and treatment. In a country trying to manage serious social problems with limited resources, this paper highlights the need for increased cooperation and collaboration between relevant parties in order to facilitate the changes necessary for disabled people to access needed health information and care.

AB This study addressed factors that played a role in the limited but effective implementation of provider-initiated HIV counseling in tuberculosis (TB) clinics in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, as part of a clinical trial. The Eastern Cape is a region with some of the highest TB and HIV rates in the world. The parent study was a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial designed to measure the impact of provider-initiated ("opt-out'') counseling on the uptake of HIV counseling and testing in newly registered TB patients. Key informants were interviewed and clinic nurses who participated in the study were invited to participate in focus group discussions (FGDs). Thematic content analysis of transcriptions was conducted on data collected during interviews and FGDs. Three major themes regarding nurse experiences were derived from analysis, indicating that multiple structural and personal factors influence the success of provider-initiated HIV counseling of TB patients in primary care settings: (1) chronic frustration with knowing what TB tasks need to be accomplished but not having the resources, including staff, to accomplish them; (2) conflict between the appreciation of the need and importance of HIV counseling and testing and the health system's recognition of their difficulties implementing it; and (3) ambivalence in their roles as care providers and educators in the context of HIV counseling and testing. Innovative and coordinated strategies are needed in this environment to facilitate greater number of patients receiving HIV counseling and testing services.

AB Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are more likely to be HIV positive. Many of these women never receive any relevant services, and those who do often access them only after events have escalated to a crisis requiring the police or emergency medical care. Evidence from other settings suggests that routinely asking women about experiences of partner violence is received positively. Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services would seem an ideal opportunity to screen for IPV in South Africa. However, in low resource settings, VCT is carried out by lay counselors with few skills. We therefore conducted a qualitative study that explored women's experience of IPV screening in VCT services, and explored implications for VCT counseling. The study was conducted in a clinic in Johannesburg where we trained the lay counselors to do IPV screening. In-depth interviews were conducted with 35 women attending VCT services. Participants were recruited before they attended VCT, and 12 women participated in a follow-up interview. A focus group was held with lay counselors a year after the intervention was implemented. Findings suggest that women were supportive of being asked about their experiences of IPV during VCT sessions. Reasons for supporting IPV screening at VCT services include the limited access of many women to health services. Many women who were aware of their HIV risk felt powerless to discuss condom use, HIV testing, and infidelity with their male partners. Women directly related such experience of gender power inequality to HIV risk. One year after training, there was no evidence of screening continuing. Our findings suggest that the focus should shift from asking about violence to equipping counselors to discuss gender inequality in relationships more broadly. This needs to be part of basic counselor training as it is integral to approaching HIV risk reduction.

AB This paper examines the way gender shaped the health behaviours, health care experiences and narratives of HIV-positive men initiating antiretroviral treatment in South Africa. We conducted participant observation and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with eight men enrolled in a public HIV treatment programme in a rural health district in KwaZulu-Natal. We also interviewed their family members and programme staff. The study found that men's narratives and experiences of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were complex. Descriptions of control and coping juxtaposed with low self-esteem and guilt. Improvements in health following treatment increased optimism about the future but were readily undermined by men's concerns about being unable to meet strongly gendered expectations in relation to family and work. Alcohol use and abuse by men themselves or by family members was found to be an important issue influencing disclosure, uptake and adherence. Given messages discouraging alcohol use during treatment, men reported self-imposed delays to enrolment while they tried to stop or reduce alcohol use, although none had sought advice or professional help in doing so. Men also felt very threatened by alcohol abuse by family members fearing accidental disclose, insults and violence. With regards to health providers, men held strong views as to appropriate and professional behaviour by programme staff, particularly regarding confidentiality. As ART programmes in Africa become established and evolve, we not only need to identify barriers to men's access and adherence but monitor their health and treatment experiences. These findings suggest that the issue of alcohol and ART warrants further investigation. Additional training for primary health care providers and counsellors on health promotion with men may be useful.

AB In South Africa, older people have become the primary caregivers of children and grandchildren infected or affected by HIV and AIDS. This study explores the determinants of the perceived ability to care for children and grandchildren in the domains of providing nursing care, communicating with ( grand) children, generating income and to relax. Structured one-on-one interviews were conducted among 409 isiXhosa speaking older people in two sites in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Results showed that perceived ability among older people to provide nursing care was primarily dependent on the level of knowledge on accessing grants and personal norm towards providing care. Perceived ability to communicate effectively with children and grandchildren was most strongly predicted by a positive attitude towards communication and perceived ability to provide income was influenced by a more negative attitude towards people living with HIV or AIDS. Perceived ability to relax was dependent on more negative attitudes towards communication, lower perceived responsibility to provide income and a higher perceived behaviour control over providing nursing care. The findings of this study add relevant information to understanding the psychosocial context in which older people provide HIV and AIDS related care and support the development of targeted programmes to assist older people in their role as caregiver.

AB A psychometric scale assessing inhibitors and facilitators of willingness to participate (WTP) in an HIV vaccine trial has not yet been developed. This study aimed to construct and derive the exploratory factor structure of such a scale. The 35-item Inhibitors and Facilitators of Willingness to Participate Scale (WPS) was developed and administered to a convenience sample of 264 Black females between the ages of 16 and 49 years living in an urban-informal settlement near Cape Town. The subscales of the WPS demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging between 0.69 and 0.82. A principal components exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of five latent factors. The factors, which accounted for 45.93% of the variance in WTP, were (1) personal costs, (2) safety and convenience, (3) stigmatisation, (4) personal gains and (5) social approval and trust. Against the backdrop of the study limitations, these results provide initial support for the reliability and construct validity of the WPS among the most eligible trial participants in the Western Cape of South Africa.

AB Following a controversial history and before South Africa started the world's largest highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) rollout, little was known about community-level information, motivation, and behavioral skills (IMB) regarding HAART in high-HIV-prevalence rural communities. The IMB model has been shown to predict behaviors that are associated with desirable HAART outcomes. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional "HAART-Felt Prospects'' survey among HIV-serostatus-unknown young adults in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal. We aimed to identify behavioral aspects of HAART preparedness that could be targeted by local interventions to enhance HAART outcomes. Data analysis included: percent correct, thematic means based on a four-point Likert-scale, and composite quotients. Subjects (N = 176) were Zulu (99%), young (mean 19 years), and severely impoverished (55%). Relatively high levels of information were reported: overall correct score was 46%, secondary-transmission-of-resistance information was highest (81%), and only 15% reported traditional or government-advocated folk remedies cure or treat HIV/AIDS. Motivation quotient was "consistent'' with favorable HAART behaviors; attitudes toward medication-taking behaviors (3.48) and condom use during HAART (3.43) ranked the highest. Desire for HIV testing (71%) was associated with HIV treatment optimism [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.0, p = 0.0004] and previous experience with good treatment outcome [AOR = 3.2, p = 0.01]. Acceptance of HAART (93%) was associated with HIV optimism [AOR = 18.0, p = 0.001] and not believing government-advocated folk remedies cure or treat HIV/AIDS [AOR = 10.0, p = 0.04]. Behavioral skills quotient was "neutral'' for favorable HAART behaviors; side-effects self-efficacy was the highest (3.16); and medication-taking self-efficacy the lowest (2.51). Only 47% believed disclosing HIV-serostatus would be easy. Despite controversy surrounding HAART initiation, these results suggest that local South African at-risk youth were relatively well-poised for HAART rollout. This conclusion is supported by subsequent successful HAART rollout locally. Community-based assessments are urgently needed as HAART rollouts continue. Adaptation of this IMB-based survey may better inform efforts to enhance HAART-program implementation in resource-limited settings globally.

AB This study assessed the uptake of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) among women attending an urban sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in South Africa. From July 2005 to June 2006, women were offered HIV testing following group information and education on HIV and STDs in the clinic waiting area. Of those who were provided with education, information, and offered HIV testing, uptake was 43.5% (2439/5612). The overall HIV prevalence among those tested was 56.5% and the prevalence of acute HIV infection was 1.2%. Of the 56.5% (3173/5612) refusing to test, the reasons for not testing were having already been tested for HIV (61.8%), being afraid to test or felt unready to test (32.5%), the need to consult with partner (0.9%), and refusing with no explanation (4.8%). In settings where high-risk patients await health care services, such as an STD clinic, failure to implement PITC is a missed opportunity for patients to benefit from counseling, prevention, early diagnosis, and referral into care and treatment for HIV infection.

AB Informed consent has historically been a cornerstone to ensuring autonomy during HIV testing. However, recent changes to global guidance on HIV testing have led to substantial debate on what policy provisions are necessary to ensure that consent remains meaningful in the context of testing. Despite disproportionate rates of testing during pregnancy, pregnant women's perspectives on the HIV testing process are underrepresented in the testing discourse. This study explores women's experiences with HIV testing and the consent process in a public antenatal clinic in South Africa. Qualitative interviews with 25 women were conducted at the clinic at either an antenatal visit or an infant immunization visit that followed HIV testing. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and coded for analysis. Women were categorized into one of the three groups based on their perceptions of choice in consenting for an HIV test. Matrices were used to allow for cross-category and cross-case comparison. Half of the women described having a clear choice in their decision to test. Others were less clear about their choice. Some women felt they had no choice in testing for HIV. None of the women stated that they were tested without having signed a consent form. We found that half of the women's narratives illustrated direct and indirect ways in which providers coerced them into taking an HIV test while receiving antenatal care. As the new guidance on HIV testing is implemented in different settings, it is critical to monitor women's testing experiences to ensure that a woman's right to make an informed, voluntary choice is not violated. Furthermore, models of testing that allow us to meet broader public health goals while simultaneously respecting women's autonomy are needed.

AB Most ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimens offer comparable levels of virological efficacy. Thus, the tolerability of the regimen becomes a distinguishing factor with implications for patient quality of life (QoL), treatment adherence, and clinical outcome. This article describes results from the CASTLE study (comparing once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir [ATV/RTV] with twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/RTV], both in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients) and an evaluation of the impact of gastrointestinal (GI) complications of treatment on patient QoL, as measured by the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) QoL questionnaire (IBS-QoL). Changes in IBS-QoL from baseline over time (to week 24) were classified as: oImprovemento (epsilon 2-point positive change from baseline), oNo changeo (2-point change), or oWorseningo (epsilon 2-point negative change). Data were collected on GI adverse events (AEs) and use of GI medications. Of the 599 patients with IBS-QoL-evaluable data through week 24, fewer patients in the ATV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group experienced grade 2-4 treatment-related GI AEs including diarrhea (3% versus 10%), nausea (5% versus 7%), and vomiting (1% on both arms). Nearly three times as many patients receiving LPV/RTV used GI medications. ATV/RTV was associated with an increase in overall IBS-QoL scores and more patients receiving ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV experienced improvement in IBS-QoL through week 24. In contrast to LPV/RTV, ATV/RTV treatment was associated with earlier and more positive improvements in QoL scores across CD4 sub-groups. Differences in the health-related QoL profile between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV may be important when selecting PI-based antiretroviral regimens.

AB With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood.

AB Expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) offers opportunities to strengthen HIV prevention in resource-limited settings. We invited 27 ART programmes from urban settings in Africa, Asia and South America to participate in a survey, with the aim to examine what preventive services had been integrated in ART programmes. Twenty-two programmes participated; eight (36%) from South Africa, two from Brazil, two from Zambia and one each from Argentina, India, Thailand, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Morocco, Uganda and Zimbabwe and one occupational programme of a brewery company included five countries (Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). Twenty-one sites (96%) provided health education and social support, and 18 (82%) provided HIV testing and counselling. All sites encouraged disclosure of HIV infection to spouses and partners, but only 11 (50%) had a protocol for partner notification. Twenty-one sites (96%) supplied male condoms, seven (32%) female condoms and 20 (91%) provided prophylactic ART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Seven sites (33%) regularly screened for sexually transmitted infections (STI). Twelve sites (55%) were involved in activities aimed at women or adolescents, and 10 sites (46%) in activities aimed at serodiscordant couples. Stigma and discrimination, gender roles and funding constraints were perceived as the main obstacles to effective prevention in ART programmes. We conclude that preventive services in ART programmes in lower income countries focus on health education and the provision of social support and male condoms. Strategies that might be equally or more important in this setting, including partner notification, prompt diagnosis and treatment of STI and reduction of stigma in the community, have not been implemented widely.

AB Multiple sexual partnerships are a driver of the HIV epidemic in southern Africa. Five linked cluster surveys in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 allowed us to measure changes in rates of multiple partnerships in these clusters in Swaziland. We selected a stratified random sample of census enumeration areas in 2002 and survey teams subsequently revisited this same sample (a random sub-sample in 2005 and 2006). For this study, analysis includes only people aged 18-29 years interviewed in communities included in all five surveys (1862 men and 2701 women). Among men, there was a significant fall in the proportion having multiple partners in the last 12 months (MP12), among those that had any, between 2002 (61%) and 2007 (46%), followed by a slight rise in 2008 (49%). For multiple partnerships in the last six months (MP6 - measured in 2005 and 2006), there was a decrease between 2005 (43%) and 2006 (25%). There was a significant decrease in multiple partnerships in the last month (MP1) between 2005 (35%) and 2006 (16%), followed by an increase in 2007 (24%) and 2008 (25%). Among women, there was a significant decrease in MP12 between 2002 (22%) and 2007 (9%), then a significant increase in 2008 (15%). There was little difference in women's MP6 between 2005 (7%) and 2006 (6%). There was also little change in women's MP1 between 2005 (5%) and 2006 (3%), with an increase from 2007 (3%) to 2008 (6%); the 2006-2008 difference was significant. A 2006 campaign to reduce multiple partnerships may have changed behaviour among men or it may have made them less likely to admit to multiple partners. The recent increase in MP12 and MP1, especially among women, may reflect behaviour or it could reflect increased willingness to report.

TI Psychosocial challenges and protective influences for socio-emotional
   coping of HIV plus adolescents in South Africa: a qualitative

AB Introduction. While the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa should lead to a reduction in mother to child transmission, mortality and orphaning, it will also be accompanied by a large number of children entering adolescence and adulthood with a chronic infectious disease. Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period for HIV-infected people in relation to mental health problems and engagement in high-risk behaviours, including non-compliance with medical treatment. The goal of this qualitative study was to develop an understanding of the psychosocial challenges as well as protective influences promoting socio-emotional coping in HIV+ adolescents in order to inform mental health promotion and HIV prevention programming for this population in South Africa. Method. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with HIV+ adolescents (25) and caregivers of HIV+ children (15) at a large HIV/AIDS Clinic in South Africa. Data were analysed thematically using NVivo8 software. Results. Psycho-social challenges for adolescents included dealing with loss of biological parents in the case of orphans; coming to terms with their HIV+ status including identity difficulties; external stigma and discrimination; and disclosure difficulties. For caregivers, disclosure and lack of financial, family and social support emerged as key challenges. Medication, HIV information, a future orientation and social support was identified as important for coping and general well-being of adolescents, with financial and social support emerging as key for promoting supportive caregiving contexts. Conclusion. While HIV+ adolescents in South Africa experience similar concerns to those in high-income countries, socio-emotional coping may be compromised by increased levels of loss due to the late roll-out of ARVS and challenges to caregiving contexts including poverty, stigma and minimally supported foster care arrangements. There is a need for mental health promotion programmes for adolescents to adopt an ecological approach, strengthening protective influences at the individual, interpersonal, community and policy levels.

AB Sport has become a popular tool for HIV prevention, based on claims that it can foster life skills that are necessary to translate knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions into actual behaviour. Empirical evidence of the effectiveness of sport-based HIV prevention programmes is, however, sorely lacking. We therefore conducted a cross-sectional survey assessing sexual behaviour and the determinants thereof among 454 youth of the Mathare Youth Sport Association (MYSA) in Kenya and a control group of 318 non-MYSA members. Multiple (ordinal) logistic regression models were applied to measure the association between MYSA membership and attitudes, subjective norms and self-efficacy related to condom use as well as sexual experience, age at sexual debut, condom use, history of concurrent relationships and number of partners in the last year. MYSA members were more likely to use condoms during the first sex act (odds ratio (OR)=2.10; 95% CI: 1.10-3.99). Consistent condom use with the current/last partner was 23.2% (36/155) among MYSA members vs. 17.2% (17/99) among the control group. Even after adjusting for media exposure - a factor associated with both MYSA membership and higher frequency of condom use - MYSA members were still found to use condoms more frequently with their current/last partner (adjusted OR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.01-2.68). Nevertheless, levels of condom use remain disturbingly low. More rigorous evaluations of sport programmes for HIV prevention are needed. When possible, programmes should be preceded by baseline assessments, trends in risk behaviour of the intervention group should be compared with those of a control group, and protocols for data collection and analysis should include measuring of and adjusting for potentially confounding factors.

ID TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; HIV; PROGRAM
AB Nearly 30% of pregnant women in South Africa are estimated to be HIV seropositive, yet adherence to guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) is often low. A pilot study was developed to see whether PMTCT services provided by the South African Government could be enhanced by the Mamekhaya program, a combination of the mothers2mothers peer-mentoring program and a culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) from the USA. Pregnant women attending two maternity clinics offering PMTCT in Gugulethu and Vanguard Townships, Cape Town, South Africa, were invited to participate in the study. Women at the intervention site (Gugulethu) received the support of a mentor mother and also attended an eight-session Mamekhaya CBI. At the control site (Vanguard), women received standard services provided by midwives and counselors. Baseline assessments were completed by all participants at enrollment (n=160), and follow-ups were completed six months later by 44% of participants. Self-reports of adherence to PMTCT practices were high across both sites (90% or more engaging in the core practices). Women at the Mamekhaya site showed significantly greater improvement in establishing social support and reducing depression scores than women at the control site. Mamekhaya participants also showed trends for better attendance at follow-up medical visits, and greater improvements in positive coping. The greatest effect of the Mamekhaya program was to increase HIV knowledge scores, particularly with regard to understanding the meaning and importance of viral load and CD4 test results. Results from this pilot study show promise that augmenting basic PMTCT services with mentor mothers and a culturally adapted CBI can be effective in conveying information and in improving the emotional outlook and hopefulness of HIV-positive pregnant women in South Africa.

AB Despite antiretroviral therapy rollout in South Africa, fewer children than expected are accessing HIV care services. Our objectives were to describe barriers and facilitators of uptake of HIV care among children. Our study involved six private-sector clinics which provide HIV care free-of-charge in and around Gauteng province, South Africa. In-depth interviews were conducted in July 2008 with 21 caregivers of HIV-infected children attending these clinics, 21 clinic staff members and three lead members of staff from affiliated care centres. Many children were only tested for HIV after being recurrently unwell. The main facility-related barriers reported were long queues, negative staff attitudes, missed testing opportunities at healthcare facilities and provider difficulties with paediatric counselling and venesection. Caregivers reported lack of money for transport, food and treatments for opportunistic infections, poor access to welfare grants and lack of coordination amongst multiple caregivers. Misperceptions about HIV, maternal guilt and fear of negative repercussions from disclosure were common. Reported facilitators included measures implemented by clinics to help with transport, support from family and day-care centres/orphanages, and seeing children's health improve on treatment. Participants felt that better public knowledge about HIV would facilitate uptake. Poverty and the implications of children's HIV infection for their families underlie many of these factors. Some staff-related and practical issues may be addressed by improved training and simple measures employed at clinics. However, changing caregiver attitudes may require interventions at both individual and societal levels. Healthcare providers should actively promote HIV testing and care-seeking for children.

AB South Africa has one of the highest rates of both rape and HIV infections. Of great concern is the possibility of HIV transmission during the assault, but adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been varied and low. We developed a telephonic psycho-social support, leaflet and adherence diary intervention for rape victims and tested its impact on adherence to PEP. A randomised control trial was conducted in the Western and Eastern Cape and 279 rape survivors were enrolled in two arms. The intervention involved the providing of an information leaflet including an adherence diary and follow-up support through telephone calls by a counsellor during the 28 days of taking the PEP. The controls received the leaflet. Follow-up interviews and tablet checks were done with 253 participants to assess adherence. The primary outcome was completion of 28 days of PEP with no more than three missed doses (94% adherence).
   There was more adherence in the intervention arm (38.2% vs. 31.9%), but the estimated intervention effect of 6.5% (95% CI: -4.6 to 17.6%) was not statistically significant, p=0.13. The intervention was associated with the reading of the pamphlet (p=0.07) and an increased use of the diary (p=0.01), but did not reduce depressive psychopathology. Overall adherence was greater amongst those who read the leaflet and used the medication diary. The study showed that the intervention was not effective in significantly improving adherence and adherence levels were low in both study arms. Further research to understand reasons for non-adherence is needed before further interventions are developed.

AB Health services in sub-Saharan Africa are under great pressure to provide adequate clinical care due to the continued HIV epidemic, and nurse-driven models of care are one means to address physician shortages. This case-control study examines the reasons for and correlates of patient referral from nurses to physicians at HIV primary care clinics in South Africa prior to initiating antiretroviral treatment. Ninety-seven HIV-infected cases who required physician consolation and 160 controls who did not require physician consultation (matched on gender, age, and date of clinic visit) were consecutively enrolled at both an urban and rural HIV primary care clinic during a 12-month period beginning in March 2006. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess correlates of patient referral to a physician. Cases were more likely to have lower CD4 cell counts and have WHO Stages III and IV disease compared to controls (p0.05). Predictors of patient referral were a CD4 cell count between 50 and 200 cells/mu l (adj OR: 5.27, 95% CI: 2.16-12.88, p0.0001), a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mu l (adj OR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.12-10.78, p=0.032), and Stage IV disease (adj OR: 4.58, 95% CI: 1.35-15.60, p=0.015). Additionally, the following ICD-10 clinical diagnoses were associated with patient referral: tuberculosis, aplastic and other anemias, and lower respiratory tract infection (p0.05). Nurses can provide adequate clinical and diagnostic management for certain clinical conditions to HIV-infected patients. Further studies are needed to examine specifically how HIV healthcare delivery can be scaled-up in resource-limited settings with a high burden of HIV, but with a minimal healthcare infrastructure.

AB Despite high levels of awareness of HIV, condom use, particularly consistent use, is suboptimal among young South African women. This paper aims to investigate the factors associated with both any condom use and consistent use by young rural women. In this study 1204 sexually active female volunteers, aged 15-26 years, were selected using a two-stage procedure in which firstly 70 clusters were selected and thereafter up to 20 women per cluster were selected, to participate in a cluster randomised controlled trial of an HIV behavioural intervention. This study is analysing cross-sectional data from a baseline survey thus no causal inferences can be drawn. A structured questionnaire was administered at a baseline interview. An estimated 19.9% of young women reported consistent condom use in the 12 months before the interview, while 44.5% reported inconsistent use. Any condom use was associated with higher condom use self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59; 95% CI 1.41, 1.77), less association of trust with suggested condom use (aOR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82, 0.91), knowing one's HIV status (aOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.52, 5.39) and having a more educated mother (aOR 1.71; 95% CI 1.26, 2.33). Having had just one partner was associated with a lesser likelihood of any condom use (aOR 0.14; 95% CI 0.10, 0.20). Consistent use, compared with inconsistent use, was associated with having just one partner (aOR 3.25; 95% CI 2.23, 4.73), less relationship conflict (aOR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75, 0.91) and higher gender equity in relationships with a male partner (aOR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15, 1.77). Our findings suggest that gender equity, monogamy and harmonious relationships play a positive role in enabling women to reduce their risk for HIV infection. Such aspects of relationship context could form a significant part of the progressive strategies required for HIV-prevention interventions to be successful.

AB This community household survey undertaken in Melmoth, a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, investigated the influence of cumulative exposure of complementary interventions by a non-governmental organisation, LoveLife which aimed to bring changes in beliefs about HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment, and to reduce sexual risk behaviour. Amongst the 1294 respondents (15-40 years of age) increasing the number of exposures to different LoveLife interventions included use of television and radio messages, billboards, a free monthly magazine for youth, special school sports and community events, involvement of youth peer educators, and support for schools through classroom programmes and by linking clinic staff and peer educators. Cumulative exposure to LoveLife interventions resulted in more respondents believing that HIV could be prevented (p0.005) and treated (p=0.007) and that people should test for HIV (p=0.03). Half of the respondents reported using a condom at last sex and cumulative exposure to LoveLife was associated with increased condom use (p0.005). However, despite exposure to LoveLife, only 41.9% respondents had ever tested for HIV and cumulative exposure to LoveLife did not significantly influence respondents going to hospital for anti-retroviral treatment. The dose-response effect of cumulative LoveLife exposure appeared to have a positive influence on some beliefs and practices, but did not discriminate the extent of LoveLife exposure nor exposure to other HIV/AIDS interventions.

AB Psychiatric disorders are more common in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) than in the general population and they exert a significant effect on many health-related outcomes. Low levels of mental health literacy and stigma may contribute to delayed treatment seeking and poorer outcomes. A convenience sample of 400 HIV-positive respondents were selected from three health clinics in Cape Town. Respondents' mental health literacy and attitudes towards psychiatric disorders were investigated. Psychiatric disorders were viewed as stress-related 70-91% of the time. Seeking help from a medical professional was often endorsed as an effective treatment option, while taking medication was rarely endorsed. Respondents held negative attitudes towards people with psychiatric disorders. In particular, people with substance abuse and PTSD were stigmatised more than those with depression and schizophrenia. The understanding of the psychobiological nature of psychiatric disorders and of existing effective treatments in PLWHA in South Africa is limited. Interventions designed to increase mental health literacy and reduce the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders may increase the likelihood of PLWHA seeking treatment should they suffer from these conditions.

AB How do people respond to the news that they are HIV positive? To date, there have been few published qualitative studies of HIV diagnosis experiences, and none focusing on Caribbean people. Twenty-five HIV-positive Caribbean people in London, UK, related their diagnosis experience and its immediate aftermath in semi-structured interviews. Diagnosis with HIV caused profound shock and distress to participants, as they associated the disease with immediate death and stigmatisation. The respondents struggled with obiographical disruptiono, the radical disjuncture between life before and after diagnosis, which led them into a state of liminality, as they found themselves obetwixt and betweeno established structural and social identities. Respondents were faced with multifaceted loss: of their known self, their present life, their envisioned future and the partner they had expected to play a role in each of these. A minority of accounts suggest that the way in which healthcare practitioners delivered the diagnosis intensified the participants' distress. This research suggests that healthcare practitioners should educate patients in specific aspects of HIV transmission and treatment, and engage closely with them in order to understand their needs and potential reactions to a positive diagnosis.

AB It has been assumed that receipt of a diagnosis of HIV is a uniquely distressing event, more so than with any other illness. The present study compared the mean scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, a measure of emotional distress, of South African patients living with HIV/AIDS, hypertension, diabetes, and both hypertension and diabetes. The differences among the four groups were non-significant, suggesting that living with HIV/AIDS may be no more emotionally distressing than other common chronic illnesses. In this research note, it is speculated that these findings may be accounted for in terms of the high prevalence of HIV in South Africa, the recent availability of antiretroviral treatment resulting in HIV being seen as a chronic illness rather than a death sentence, and the base rate of mental health problems among the South African population.

AB The occurrence of high rates of alcohol consumption in a context of high HIV prevalence in South Africa poses a significant health challenge for this country. This paper aims to answer three questions that could further our knowledge regarding the links between alcohol use and HIV infection: (a) oAre problem drinkers more likely to have multiple concurrent partners than those who are not?o; (b) oAre condoms applied less effectively and less consistently by problem drinkers compared to those who are not?o; (c) oAre the female sexual partners of problem drinkers different from those who are not?o Two cross-sectional HIV bio-behavioural surveillance surveys using Respondent-Driven Sampling were conducted in two peri-urban settings on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. Eight hundred and forty-eight men aged 25-55 years who have multiple, concurrent female sexual partners were recruited. Problem drinkers had a score of epsilon 3 on the CAGE questionnaire. Questions enquired about partner numbers, condom use and partner traits. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to determine significant associations between outcome variables and problem drinking. Fifty-eight percent of men were problem drinkers. Compared to non-problem drinkers, problem drinkers were significantly more likely to report having any symptom of a STI; not using condoms due to drinking; inconsistent condom use with all partner types; that their most recent once-off partner was unemployed; having met their most recent partner at an alcohol-serving venue; and having had a once-off sexual relationship. Alcohol may fuel once-off sexual encounters, often characterised by transactional sex and women's limited authority to negotiate sex and condom use; factors that can facilitate transmission of HIV. HIV prevention interventions specifically targeting drinkers, the contexts in which problem drinking occurs and multiple sexual partnering are urgently needed.

AB The study takes stock of the exponential growth in the number of new civil-society organisations (CSOs) working in the HIV/AIDS field in East and Southern Africa during the period 1996-2004. We researched this development through a survey of 439 CSOs in six countries and case studies focused on the evolution of community responses to HIV/AIDS in specific communities in eight countries. We describe the types of CSOs that emerged, their relationships with governments and donors, and their activities, organisational characteristics and funding requirements. The data presented show that the vision of social mobilisation of HIV/AIDS responses through community-level organisations has faced strong external challenges. Evidence from survey data, national HIV/AIDS spending assessments and case studies shows that in some respects the changing international aid environment undermines the prospects for development of the civil-society sector's contributions in HIV/AIDS responses. Of particular interest is to understand how the "Three Ones'' and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness have reshaped international funding for HIV/AIDS responses. There has been relatively little attention paid to the impact of the new management and funding modalities - including national performance frameworks, general budget support, joint funding arrangements and basket funds - on civil-society agencies at the forefront of community HIV/AIDS responses. Evidence is presented to show that in important respects the new modalities limit the unique contribution that CSOs can make to national HIV/AIDS responses. It is also shown that the drive to rapidly intensify the scale of HIV/AIDS responses has involved using community organisations as service providers for externally formulated programmes. We discuss this as a strong threat to the development of sustainable civil-society economies as well as to CSOs' diversity and responsiveness. The ways in which CSOs are responding to these challenges are discussed, pointing to possibilities for a new phase of development of the civil-society sector.

DE empowerment; gender; media; symbolic; women
ID HIV/AIDS MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; PREVENTION; IMPACT; AIDS; TIME
AB It is widely agreed empowering women to take control of their lives and sexual health is a key strategy for tackling gender inequalities and HIV/AIDS, but to date this has been exceedingly difficult to achieve. This paper explores how a sample of South African media represent the relationship between gender and HIV/AIDS in the interests of understanding the symbolic context in which HIV/AIDS programmers conduct their work. The starting assumption is that representations of gender and HIV in the symbolic sphere provide the context within which people charged with designing and implementing women's empowerment interventions - government officials and NGO programme managers - construct understandings of this relationship and how best to tackle it. Content analysis was conducted on four South African newspapers between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2008. Newspapers selected are widely read by "opinion leaders''; government officials and NGO programme managers. It is accepted that women's empowerment needs to involve top-down and bottom-up approaches. Dominant media representations portray women's empowerment as almost entirely a top-down process in which powerful actors are responsible for identifying and implementing women-focused interventions. Newspapers pay little attention to the need for the mobilisation of women via bottom-up programmes. Furthermore, while the media focuses on structural-and individual-level interventions, there is limited discussion of the importance of community-development interventions. Community-development interventions emphasise the need to build and support community-led responses to HIV. For women's empowerment to be successful interventions need to be at all levels. Currently, much emphasis is placed on the need for "socially responsible'' media reporting in South Africa that supports positive social development and social justice. Against this background, we conclude media representations of appropriate ways to tackle gender and HIV/AIDS are limiting in ways that undermine awareness of the need for community-led interventions to empower women.

SO AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The 516G > T polymorphism in exon 4 of the CYP2B6 gene has been associated with increased plasma Efavirenz (EFV) concentrations. EFV concentrations greater than the recommended therapeutic range have been associated with the increased likelihood of developing adverse CNS effects. The aims of this study were to a) determine the presence of the 516G > T and other CYP2B6 exon 4 polymorphisms in a South African group of HIV-infected individuals b) investigate the relationship between the EFV plasma concentrations, the CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism and the occurrence of CNS related side effects in this group of patients and c) develop and validate a rapid method for determination of EFV in plasma.
   Method: Data from 80 patients is presented. Genetic polymorphisms in exon 4 of the CYP2B6 gene were identified using PCR amplification of this region followed by sequencing of the amplification products. EFV concentrations were analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. Assessment of the presence of CNS related side effects following EFV initiation were elicited with the use of a questionnaire together with physical examination.
   Results: Plasma EFV concentrations displayed high inter-individual variability amongst subjects with concentrations ranging from 94 mu g/l to 23227 mu g/l at 2 weeks post initiation of treatment. For the 516G > T polymorphism the following frequencies were observed 23% of patients were TT homozygous, 36% GG and 41% GT. The TT homozygous patients had significantly higher EFV concentrations vs. those with the wild (GG) genotype (p < 0.05). Patients who experienced no side effects had significantly lower EFV plasma concentrations vs. the group of patients which experienced the most severe side effects (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The significant association between the 516G > T polymorphism and plasma EFV concentrations has been demonstrated in this study. A rapid and sensitive method for the measurement of plasma EFV concentration was developed and validated.

TI Experiences in conducting multiple community-based HIV prevention trials
   among women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: South Africa, with its scientific capacity, good infrastructure and high HIV incidence rates, is ideally positioned to conduct large-scale HIV prevention trials. The HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council conducted four phase III and one phase IIb trials of women-initiated HIV prevention options in KwaZulu-Natal between 2003 and 2009. A total of 7046 women participated, with HIV prevalence between 25% and 45% and HIV incidence ranging from 4.5-9.1% per year. Unfortunately none of the interventions tested had any impact on reducing the risk of HIV acquisition; however, extremely valuable experience was gained, lessons learned and capacity built, while the communities gained associated benefits.
   Experience: Our experience in conducting these trials ranged from setting up community partnerships to developing clinical research sites and dissemination of trial results. Community engagement included setting up community-based research sites with approval from both political and traditional leaders, and developing community advisory groups to assist with the research process. Community-wide education on HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention, treatment and care was provided to over 90 000 individuals. Myths and misconceptions were addressed through methods such as anonymous suggestion boxes in clinic waiting areas and intensive education and counselling. Attempts were made to involve male partners to foster support and facilitate recruitment of women. Peer educator programmes were initiated to provide ongoing education and also to facilitate recruitment of women to the trials. Recruitment strategies such as door-to-door recruitment and community group meetings were initiated. Over 90% of women enrolled were retained.
   Community benefits from the trial included education on HIV prevention, treatment and care and provision of ancillary care (such as Pap smears, reproductive health care and referral for chronic illnesses). Social benefits included training of home-based caregivers and sustainable ongoing HIV prevention education through peer educator programmes.
   Challenges: Several challenges were encountered, including manipulation by participants of their eligibility criteria in order to enroll in the trial. Women attempted to co-enroll in multiple trials to benefit from financial reimbursements and individualised care. The trials became ethically challenging when participants refused to take up referrals for care due to stigma, denial of their HIV status and inadequate health infrastructure. Lack of disclosure of HIV status to partners and family members was particularly challenging. Some of the ethical dilemmas put to the test our responsibility as researchers and our obligation to provide health care to research participants.
   Conclusion: Conducting these five trials in a period of six years provided us with invaluable insights into trial implementation, community participation, recruitment and retention, provision of care and dissemination of trial results. The critical mass of scientists trained as clinical trialists will continue to address the relentless HIV epidemic in our setting and ensure our commitment to finding a biomedical HIV prevention option for women in the future.

TI Reduced referral and case fatality rates for severe symptomatic
   hyperlactataemia in a South African public sector antiretroviral
   programme: a retrospective observational study
SO AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; LACTIC-ACIDOSIS; THERAPY; STAVUDINE; WOMEN; RISK
AB Background: Interventions to promote prevention and earlier diagnosis of severe symptomatic hyperlactataemia (SHL) were implemented in the Western Cape provincial antiretroviral programme (South Africa) from 2004. Interventions included clinician education, point-of-care lactate meters, switch from stavudine to zidovudine in high risk patients and stavudine dose reduction. This study assessed trends in referral rate, severity at presentation and case fatality rate for severe SHL.
   Methods: Retrospective study of severe SHL cases diagnosed at a referral facility from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008. Severe SHL was defined as patients with compatible symptoms and serum lactate >= 5 mmol/l attributable to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Cumulative ART exposure at referring ART clinics was used to calculate referral rates.
   Results: There were 254 severe SHL cases. The referral rate (per thousand patient years [py] ART exposure) peaked in 2005 (20.4/1000py), but fell to 1.3/1000py by 2008 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.07, 95%CI 0.04-0.11). In 2003, 66.7% of cases presented with a standard bicarbonate (SHCO3) level <15 mmol/l, but this fell to 12.5% by 2008 (p for trend < 0.001). Case fatality rate fell from a peak of 33.3% in 2004 to 0% in 2008 (p for trend = 0.002).
   Conclusions: These trends suggest the interventions were associated with reduced referral, less severe metabolic acidosis at presentation and improved survival.

TI Lack of association between stavudine exposure and lipoatrophy,
   dysglycaemia, hyperlactataemia and hypertriglyceridaemia: a prospective
   cross sectional study
SO AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Stavudine continues to be widely used in resource poor settings despite its toxicity. Our objective was to determine association between plasma stavudine concentrations and lipoatrophy, concentrations of glucose, lactate and triglycerides.
   Methods: Participants were enrolled in a cross-sectional study with lipoatrophy assessment, oral glucose tolerance test, fasting triglycerides, finger prick lactate, and stavudine concentrations. Individual predictions of the area under the concentration curve (AUC) were obtained using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between stavudine geometric mean ratio > 1 and impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlactataemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and lipoatrophy.
   Results: There were 47 study participants with a median age of 34 years and 83% were women. The median body mass index and waist: hip ratio was 24.5 kg/m(2) and 0.85 respectively. The median duration on stavudine treatment was 14.5 months. The prevalence of lipoatrophy, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlactataemia, and hypertriglyceridaemia were 34%, 19%, 4%, 32%, and 23% respectively. Estimated median (interquartile range) stavudine AUC was 2191 (1957 to 2712) ng*h/mL. Twenty two participants had stavudine geometric mean ratio > 1. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed no association between stavudine geometric mean ratio > 1 and impaired fasting glucose (odds ratio (OR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.19), impaired glucose tolerance (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 19.42), hyperlactataemia (OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.63 to 7.66), hypertriglyceridaemia (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.44 to 7.04), and lipoatrophy (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.79).
   Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of metabolic complications of stavudine, but these were not associated with plasma stavudine concentrations. Until there is universal access to safer antiretroviral drugs, there is a need for further studies examining the pathogenesis of stavudine-associated toxicities.

CA ART-A Consortium
TI A comparative analysis of HIV drug resistance interpretation based on
   short reverse transcriptase sequences versus full sequences
SO AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: As second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) becomes more accessible in resource-limited settings (RLS), the need for more affordable monitoring tools such as point-of-care viral load assays and simplified genotypic HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) tests increases substantially. The prohibitive expenses of genotypic HIVDR assays could partly be addressed by focusing on a smaller region of the HIV reverse transcriptase gene (RT) that encompasses the majority of HIVDR mutations for people on ART in RLS. In this study, an in silico analysis of 125,329 RT sequences was performed to investigate the effect of submitting short RT sequences (codon 41 to 238) to the commonly used virco (R) TYPE and Stanford genotype interpretation tools.
   Results: Pair-wise comparisons between full-length and short RT sequences were performed. Additionally, a non-inferiority approach with a concordance limit of 95% and two-sided 95% confidence intervals was used to demonstrate concordance between HIVDR calls based on full-length and short RT sequences.
   The results of this analysis showed that HIVDR interpretations based on full-length versus short RT sequences, using the Stanford algorithms, had concordance significantly above 95%. When using the virco (R) TYPE algorithm, similar concordance was demonstrated (>95%), but some differences were observed for d4T, AZT and TDF, where predictions were affected in more than 5% of the sequences. Most differences in interpretation, however, were due to shifts from fully susceptible to reduced susceptibility (d4T) or from reduced response to minimal response (AZT, TDF) or vice versa, as compared to the predicted full RT sequence. The virco (R) TYPE prediction uses many more mutations outside the RT 41-238 amino acid domain, which significantly contribute to the HIVDR prediction for these 3 antiretroviral agents.
   Conclusions: This study illustrates the acceptability of using a shortened RT sequences (codon 41-238) to obtain reliable genotype interpretations by virco (R) TYPE and Stanford algorithms. Implementation of this simplified protocol could significantly reduce the cost of both resistance testing and ARV treatment monitoring in RLS.

AB Background: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an important complication of HAART in sub-Saharan Africa, where opportunistic infections (OIs) including mycobacteria and cryptococcus are common. The immune system's role in HIV infected patients is complex with cytokine expression strongly influencing HIV infection and replication.
   Methods: We determined the expression patterns of 10 cytokines by Luminex multi-analyte profiling in 17 IRIS nested case-control pairs participating in a prospective South African cohort initiating anti-retroviral therapy.
   Results: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression was significantly elevated in IRIS cases compared to controls (median 9.88 pg/ml versus 2.68 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.0057), while other cytokines displayed non-significant differences in expression. Significant correlation was observed between IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma expression in the IRIS patients.
   Conclusions: Significantly increased expression levels of IFN-gamma suggest that this cytokine possibly plays a role in IRIS pathology and is a potential diagnostic marker.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that are of concern due to their potential human health effects. A laser induced fluorescence (LIF) selective screening technique has been developed based on the sampling of atmospheric PAHs onto a novel silicone rubber trap. After fluorescence screening, analytes on the traps can be quantified by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The use of the traps in a denuder configuration, where two traps in series are separated by a quartz fibre filter, allows for the monitoring of both gaseous and particle phase PAHs, which is important from a human health impact perspective.
   This paper reports on the application of the denuder technology and LIF method to the monitoring of PAH emissions produced from household fires, diesel internal combustion engines, sugar cane burning and industrial emissions in South Africa. Naphthalene was found to be the most abundant PAH in all cases, with gaseous concentrations monitored in the primary trap ranging from 1.8 mu g.m(-3) (diesel vehicular emissions) to 26 mu g.m(-3) (industrial emissions). Breakthrough of naphthalene occurred at sampling volumes > 5 l. Total transfer and detection of analytes collected on the traps is possible with TD-GC-MS, which enhances detection limits and allows for shorter sampling times and flow rates. It has been demonstrated that our method performs well in practical applications and real PAH concentrations.

AB The diagnosis and management of asthma in young children is difficult, since there are many different wheezy phenotypes with varying underlying aetiologies and outcomes. This review discusses the different approaches to managing young children with wheezy illnesses presented in recently published global guidelines. Four major guidelines published since 2007 are considered. Helpful approaches are presented to assist the clinician to decide whether a clinical diagnosis of asthma can, or should be made in a young child with a recurrent wheezy illness and which treatments would be appropriate, dependent on risk factors, age of presentation, response to initial treatment and safety considerations. Each of the guidelines provide useful information for clinicians assessing young children with recurrent wheezy illnesses. There are differences in classification of the disease and treatment protocols. Although a firm diagnosis of asthma may only be made retrospectively in some cases and there are several effective guidelines to initiating treatment. Consistent review of the need for ongoing treatment with a particular pharmacological modality is essential, since many children with recurrent wheezing in infancy go into spontaneous remission. It is probable that newer biomarkers of airway inflammation will assist the clinician as to when to initiate and when to continue pharmacological treatment in the future.

TI Asking About Ambivalence: A Different Kind of Therapist Neutrality
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FAMILY THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
ID SYMPTOMS; PERSPECTIVE; NARCISSISM; SESSION
AB Recent articulations of systems theory emphasize the self-organiza-tion and autonomy of systems. From this perspective it was previously seen that symptomatic behavior reflects the conservation of an ambivalent autonomy embodying the system's striving for an ideal way of living and the simultaneous failure of this quest. Treatment typically opposes the symptom and allies itself with the idealistic pole of the ambivalence, thereby discounting the system's ambivalent autonomy. This often strengthens symptomatic efforts to conserve the ambivalence. Careful questioning can be used to circumvent this dilemma and this paper illustrates this type of therapist neutrality by means of a case example.

TI The Association Between Medical Costs and Participation in the Vitality

AB Purpose. Examine the association between the levels of participation in an incentive-based health promotion program (Vitality) and inpatient medica claims among members of a major health insurer.
   Design. A 1-Year, cross-sectional, correlational analyses of engagement with a health promotion program and hospital claims experience (admissions costs, days in hospital, and admission rate) of members of a national private health insurer.
   Setting. Adult members of south Africa's largest national private health insurer, Discovery Health. Insured members were also eligible for voluntary membership in an insurance-linked incentivized health promotion program, Vitality.
   Subjects. The study sample included 948,974 adult members of the Discovery Health plan for the year 2006. Of these, 591,134 (62.3%) were also members of the Vitality health promotion program.
   Measures. The study sample was grouped based on registration and the level of engagement with the Vitality health promotion program into the following: not registered (37.5%), registered but not engaged with any health promotion activity (21.9%), low engagement (30.9%), and high engagement (9.5%). High engagement was defined a priori by the accumulation of an arbitrary number of points on the Vitality program, allocated against specific activities (knowledge, fitness-related activities, assessment and screening, and healthy choices). Hospital admission costs, the number of days in hospital, and hospital admission rates were compared among highly engaged members and those members who were not enrolled in the program, nonengaged, and lowly engaged. Data were normalized for age, gender, plan type, and type, and chronic disease status.
   Results. Highly engaged members had lower costs per patient, shorter stays in hospital, and fewer admissions compared with other groups (p < .001). Low or no engagement was all associated with lower hospital costs. Admission rates were also 7.4% lower for cardiovascular disease, 13.2% lower for cancers, and 20.7% lower for endocrine and metabolic diseases in the highly engaged group compared with any of the other groups (p < .01).
   Conclusions. Engagement in an incentive-based wellness program, offered by a health insurer, was associated with lower health care costs (Am J Health Promot 2010;24[3]:199-204.)

TI PROTECTION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT: CONCEPTS,
   POSITION SEEKING, AND THE INTERACTION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The negotiation of the 2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples prompted the airing of African views on the protection of indigenous peoples, illustrated here by such issues as preferential treatment, collective versus individual rights, and the right to self-determination. The author stresses the need for systematic consideration of African particularities in focusing on the interactions between indigenous, national, and international law, exemplified by South African case law, which is seen as a laboratory where all these strands converge.

AB Landmark-based morphometric analysis holds promise for quantitative assessment of craniofacial dysmorphology. We describe an application of facial shape analysis to characterize the facial anomalies associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a mixed ancestry population. Generalized Procrustes analysis, regression and discriminant function analysis were applied to stereo-photogrammetrically derived 3D coordinates of landmarks taken from 34 subjects (n = 17 FAS and n = 17 normal controls). Four shape analyses were carried out, namely a comparison of the FAS and control facial shapes at age 5, and one at age 12; a comparison of the FAS facial shapes at ages 5 and 12; and a comparison of control facial shapes at ages 5 and 12. The first two analyses showed that the FAS face is characterized by small palpebral fissures, a thin upper lip, and midfacial hypoplasia. Classification of subjects as having FAS using leave-one-out cross-validation showed that the 5-year-old group could be classified with 95.46% accuracy and the 12-year-olds with 80.13% accuracy. The third and fourth analyses revealed that the differences in facial shape between FAS individuals in different age groups were more pronounced than for control individuals, supporting the notion that FAS facial anomalies diminish with age. Geometric morphometric analysis of stereo-photogrammetrically derived 3D facial landmarks allows visualization of the facial anomalies associated with FAS, as well as classification of facial shapes.

AB Rationale: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) epidemics are rapidly expanding in South Africa. Our initial report of HIV-associated XDR TB in South Africa revealed rapid and near complete mortality. Lower mortality has been described in the literature, but few of these patients have been HIV coinfected.
   Objectives: To characterize mortality from MDR and XDR TB in a setting with high HIV-coinfection rates.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study among 654 MDR and XDR TB cases diagnosed in Tugela Ferry, South Africa, from 2005 to 2007. Demographics and HIV status were abstracted from available medical records.
   Measurements and Main Results: Survival was determined from the date of sputum collection until October 2008 and correlated with year of diagnosis and drug-susceptibility test results. From 2005 to 2007, 272 MDR TB and 382 XDR TB cases were diagnosed; HIV-coinfection rates were 90 and 98%, respectively. One-year mortality was 71% for MDR and 83% for XDR TB patients; 40% of MDR TB and 51% of XDR TB cases died within 30 days of sputum collection. One-year mortality among both MDR and XDR TB patients improved from 2005 to 2007; however, the majority of deaths still occurred within the first 30 days. One-year and 30-day mortality rates were worse with greater degree of drug resistance (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Mortality from MDR and XDR TB in this high HIV-prevalence region is extraordinarily high, particularly within the first 30 days. Efforts to reduce mortality must focus on earlier diagnosis and early initiation of second-line TB and antiretroviral therapy.

TI The crystal-structure and vacancy distribution in 6C pyrrhotite
SO AMERICAN MINERALOGIST

   superstructure
ID CHEMISTRY
AB The crystal structure of a 6C pyrrhotite from Mponeng Mine, South Africa, has been refined using starting atomic parameters postulated by Koto et al. ( 1975), This pyrrhotite is monoclinic and is described in the non-standard space group Fd, so that the metrically orthorhombic unit-cell shape is preserved. The cell symmetry is monoclinic with dimensions a = 6.897(2), b = 11.954(3), c = 34.521(7), and with beta = 90.003(4)degrees. The structure has been refined with anisotropic displacement parameters to R = 0.029 using 1493 observable reflections with I > 2 sigma(I) and R = 0.034 for all 1800 reflections. The internal R(int) is 0.023 for the symmetrically equivalent reflection data. The composition of the crystal, as determined by electron microprobe analysis is Fe(10.91)Ni(0.05)S(12).
   The crystal structure resembles that of the 5C pyrrhotite in that the atomic positions of the Fe and S atoms are arranged in a very similar fashion, the only real difference being the arrangement of partially occupied iron sites. The coordination of the iron atoms is octahedral and short Fe-Fe distances along the c-axis are also encountered in this structure.
   The vacancy distribution is similar to that postulated by Koto et al. (1975) and is characterized by the stacking of two approximately half-occupied sites, followed by an essentially fully occupied layer. This is however a simplification and results in a composition that is too metal-rich. Two other slightly defect sites with occupancies of 0.90 and 0.87 are also present in the structure, and all layers contain both fully occupied and partially occupied sites. Refinement of the occupancies of all these sites gives rise to an atomic distribution that resembles the measured composition most closely, and is refined as Fe(10.99)S(12).
   The powder diffraction pattern of this structure is compared to the very similar pattern of the 5C structure. The crystal structure is also given in the more conventional Cc setting so as to be compatible with the available crystallographic software that cannot normally accommodate the Fd space group.

AB High-pressure and high-temperature phase relation on Mg0.74Fe0.26-stautrolite composition with excess water in the system FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO-H2O was experimentally determined at 12-19 kbar and 850-1050 degrees C, with a focus Oil the lower-pressure stability limit of magnesian staurolite. The experimental results show that the stability field of staurolite ill the system shifts to higher temperatures as compared to that Of pure-Mg staurolite. At 950 degrees C, the lower-pressure stability limit is located between 15 and 14 kbar. This study demonstrates that staurolite breaks down with isothermal decompression by a series of reactions at 950 degrees C: St --> Opx + Crn + Melt and St + Opx --> Spr --> Melt. The Mg+ [=Mg/(Fe+Mg)] of staurolite in the former reaction is 0.7. When staurolite coexists with orthopyroxene in run products, the staurolite Mg' is decreased to 0.6-0.5. Moderate-Mg staurolite (Mg+ = similar to 0.5) in natural occurrences has been reported as inclusion minerals in poikiloblastic garnets within Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) metamorphic rocks from major collisional orogenic belts in southern India and southern Africa. The experimental data presented in our study suggest the possibility that the staurolite-bearing UHT metamorphic rocks had experienced high-pressure metamorphism and/or UHT extreme metamorphism during the prograde metamorphic stage.

AB We report the occurrence of unusual lamellar (random and regular subparallel) intergrowths of corundum and symplectic intergrowth of spinel with orthopyroxene in an ultrahigh-temperature Al-Mg granulite from the Southern Marginal Zone of the Limpopo Belt, South Africa. Separate compositions are suggested for the homogenous phase that might have existed prior to the formation of the two types of lamellar intergrowths of corundum with orthopyroxene. In the case of random lamellar corundum + orthopyroxene intergrowth, the estimated precursor composition is similar to Fe-Mg garnet, while, although speculative, an ultrahigh-Al orthopyroxene precursor is suggested to account for the exsolution nature of the unique regular subparallel corundum lamellae in orthopyroxene. Considering that the stability field of Fe-Mg-rich garnet relative to orthopyroxene + corundum extends to lower pressures, the estimated garnet composition (X(Mg) = similar to 0.65) is most likely stable at low pressures of similar to 5 kbar. Such low pressures are further supported by the Fe-Mg-rich garnet compositional nature of the pre-spinel-intergrowth orthopyroxene. Given the rare preservation of the mineral assemblages typical of prograde metamorphism in granulite facies rocks, our discovery of corundum lamellar intergrowth with orthopyroxene from an ultrahigh-temperature Al-Mg granulite is unique.

AB Elevated plasma corticosterone during stressful events is linked to rapid changes in behavior in vertebrates and can mediate learning and memory consolidation. We tested the importance of acute corticosterone elevation in aversive learning of a novel stressor by wild male eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). We found that inhibiting corticosterone elevation (using metyrapone, a corticosterone synthesis blocker) during an encounter with a novel attacker impaired immediate escape responses and limited learning and recall during future encounters. In the wild and in outdoor enclosures, lizards whose acute corticosterone response was blocked by an earlier metyrapone injection did not alter their escape behavior during repeated encounters with the attacker. Control-injected (unblocked) lizards, however, progressively increased flight initiation distance and decreased hiding duration during subsequent encounters. Aversive responses were also initially higher for control lizards exposed to a higher intensity first attack. Further, we demonstrate a role of corticosterone elevation in recollection, since unblocked lizards had heightened antipredator responses 24-28 h later. Exogenously restoring corticosterone levels in metyrapone-injected lizards maintained aversive behaviors and learning at control (unblocked) levels. We suggest that the corticosterone mediation of antipredator behaviors and aversive learning is a critical and general mechanism for the behavioral flexibility of vertebrate prey.

AB The ultimate causes of evolution of highly specialized pollination systems are little understood. We investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal, using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system. Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but food-deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination. Population genetic data indicated that both food-and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among-population gene flow than do rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species.

AB Social interactions of conspecifics are a function of complex relationships involving resource defense, anti-predatory tactics, and mate acquisition. Consequently, individuals often associate non-randomly with conspecifics in their habitats, with spatial distributions of adults ranging from territorial spacing to aggregations. Site tenacity and cohabitation patterns have been well studied in many species of terrestrial salamander; however, less is understood about these behaviors in aquatic species. We examined the cohabitation patterns of intrasexual and intersexual pairs of the federally threatened, paedomorphic San Marcos salamander (Eurycea nana) under artificial shelters in a laboratory setting over a 20-day period. We found that intrasexual female pairs and intersexual pairs were found cohabiting more often than intrasexual male pairs. We also assessed site tenacity by examining shelter affinity and found that both males and females inhabited one of the two shelters more often than expected from random habitation, regardless of whether they were in intersexual or intrasexual pairings. Our results indicate that although both sexes of Eurycea nana exhibit site affinity, the sex of individuals is an important determinant of cohabitation patterns.

AB Matrix solid-phase dispersion and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used for the rapid screening of 36 pesticides in agricultural products. Homogenized sample (0.5 g), C(8)-modified silica (0.5 g) and Na(2)SO(4) (1 g) were mixed and transferred to a cartridge containing activated silica (0.5 g). Best recoveries (> 60%) were found using dichloromethane-ethyl acetate (4: 1) for elution. Analytical characteristics at spiking levels (10-100 mu g/kg) were calculated for each pesticide. Matrix effects were studied by comparing the slopes of the matrix-matched calibration curves. Fruit and vegetable samples from South Africa complied with EU and South African current regulation, except for cypermethrin in green beans.

AB The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

AB Small to medium-sized central African forest artiodactyls constitute a diverse yet heavily hunted group composed primarily of species within the genera Cephalophus, Neotragus, Tragelaphus and Hyemoschus. Of these genera, Cephalophus is the richest with as many as seven sympatric species known to occur in central African forests. However, differentiating species from their faeces or from tissue where the whole carcass is unavailable is very difficult. In order to develop a robust molecular diagnostic for species identification, a database of mitochondrial cytochrome b (553 bp) and control region (similar to 675 bp) sequences was compiled from all forest Cephalophus species and other similarly sized, sympatric Tragelaphus, Neotragus and Hyemoschus species. Reference phylogenies from each marker were then used to recover the identity of sequences obtained from unknown faecal samples collected in the field. Results were then compared to determine which region best recovered species identity with the highest statistical support. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were also assessed as an alternative method for rapid species identification. Of the methods examined, tree-based analyses built on a geographically comprehensive database of control region sequences was the best means of reliably recovering species identity from central African duikers. However, three sister taxa appear indistinguishable (Cephalophus callipygus, Cephalophus ogilbyi and Cephalophus weynsi) and not all species were monophyletic. This lack of monophyly may be due to incomplete lineage sorting commonly observed in recently derived taxa, hybridization or the presence of nuclear translocated copies of mitochondrial DNA. The high level of intra-specific variation and lack of robust species-specific diagnostic sites made an RFLP-based approach to duiker species identification difficult to implement. The tree-based control region diagnostic presented here has many important applications including fine-scale mapping of species distributions, identification of confiscated tissue and environmental impact assessments.

AB Concentrations of adrenal steroid metabolites in feces are routinely used to assess the welfare of animals that are the subject of conservation efforts. The assumption that low and declining corticoid concentrations indicate the absence of stress and acclimation, respectively, is often made without experimental support or wild-animal comparisons, although intrinsic control of adrenal steroids might occur even under ongoing stress and distress. We adopted the capture and 11-week captivity of 18 black (Diceros bicornis: 11 males, seven females) and 52 white (Ceratotherium simum: 22 males, 30 females) rhinoceros as an experimental test of the relationship between corticoid concentrations and stress (translocation) and measured for suppressed gonad function as an indicator of distress - the biological cost of cumulative stressors. Fecal samples collected from the rectum at capture and during captivity were stored frozen and their corticoid, and androgen (in males) or progestin (in females), concentrations determined by radioimmunoassay. Corticoid profiles followed the expected pattern of being two to five times pre-capture levels (ng g-1: black rhino: female 24.5 +/- 3.7, male 23.9 +/- 2.2; white rhino: female 16.3 +/- 1.6, male 12.3 +/- 2.4) for up to 17 days after capture and declined with time in captivity. Black rhinoceros and male white rhinoceros corticoids declined below pre-capture values and were associated with suppressed levels of androgens and progestins with increased time in captivity. Declining corticoids could not be interpreted as acclimation or the absence of stressors, without also measuring for distress in African rhinoceros. White rhinoceros female corticoid values remained elevated, although their gonad steroid levels were also suppressed. We discuss our findings for the management of rhinoceros in the wild and captivity.

AB Divergent selection resulted in Merino lines that differ markedly for reproduction. These lines were selected from the same base population from 1986 to 2009. Selection was initially based on maternal ranking values for reproduction in both ewe and ram progeny. The maternal ranking scores were augmented by breeding values from a single-trait repeatability model since 2003. The site and severity of flystrike were recorded for mature breeding ewes in the flock from 2007 to 2009. The following details were captured: animal number, site of the strike (body or breech) and the severity of the strike (1=mild to 5=severe). Breech strikes amounted to 92.1% of all strikes and this trend was consistent across years. High-line ewes were less likely (P < 0.05) than low-line ewes to be suffering from breech strike. Ewes that suffered from breech strike during a reference year were more likely to be struck again during subsequent years, when compared with contemporaries not affected by breech strike in the reference year. When breech strike and body strike were assessed in a joint preliminary analysis, it seemed that body strike was generally more severe when diagnosed than breech strike. It was concluded that Merino sheep selected for improved reproduction for >20 years were less likely to be affected by breech strike than contemporaries selected for low reproduction.

AB Heritability estimates for, and genetic correlations among neck wrinkle score, body wrinkle score, breech wrinkle score and the absence of breech strike were determined on 2918 16-month hoggets from a selection experiment with South African Merinos. Data were obtained from the lamb drops of 9 years between 1998 and 2007, born as the progeny of 247 sires and 1250 dams. All progeny born until 2002 were subjected to the Modified Mules operation as lambs (n = 1799). However, due to international pressure to phase out the Mules operation, animals from 2003 onwards were not mulesed (n = 1119). During both periods, the experimental animals were maintained in single flocks (separated on sex) after weaning. Progeny were subjected to visual appraisal of wrinkle scores (range) on the neck (1-6), body (1-5) and breech (1-6) at an age of similar to 16 months. The occurrence of blowfly strike in the breech area (breech strike) was recorded in all animals during the wool growth period of a year from shearing as weaners. Two four-trait animal models were fitted to obtain (co)variance components and ratios from the separate datasets with neck wrinkle score; body wrinkle score, breech wrinkle score and the absence of breech strike, all defined as threshold traits. Estimates of heritability for breech wrinkle score amounted to 0.27 and 0.45 for the mulesed and unmulesed groups, respectively. The absence of breech strike on the underlying scale was also heritable for the mulesed (0.33) and unmulesed (0.46) groups; translating to heritability estimates of 0.074 and 0.157, respectively, on the observed scale. The genetic correlations of wrinkle scores with absence of breech strike were generally favourable, but significant only for neck wrinkle score (-0.57) and breech wrinkle score (-0.45) in the unmulesed group. It was concluded that South African Merino sheep would respond to selection against breech strike under conditions of adequate challenge. Based on results from unmulesed sheep, selection for plainer sheep is also expected to result in a favourable correlated response in breech strike.

AB Field line resonances have been observed for decades by ground-based and in situ instruments. The driving mechanism(s) are still unclear, although previous work has provided strong grounds that coherent waves in the solar wind may be a source. Here we present further evidence, with the use of multitaper analysis, a sophisticated spectrum estimation technique. A set of windows (dpss tapers) is chosen with characteristics that best suit the width of the narrowband peaks to be identified. The orthogonality of the windows allows for a confidence level ( of say 95%) against a null hypothesis of a noisy spectrum, so that significant peaks can be identified. Employing multitaper analysis we can determine the phase and amplitude coherence at the sampling rate of the data sets and, over their entire duration. These characteristics make this technique superior to single windowing or wavelet analysis. A high degree of phase and amplitude ( greater then 95%) coherence is demonstrated between a 2.1 mHz field line resonance observed by the SHARE radar at Sanae, Antarctica and the solar wind oscillation detected by WIND and ACE satellites.

AB Field line resonances (FLR) driven by compressional waves are an important mechanism for the generation of ULF geomagnetic pulsations observed at all latitudes during local daytime. References to observations of toroidal standing Alfv,n mode oscillations with clearly L-dependent frequencies from spacecraft in the outer magnetosphere for L > 3 are limited in the literature. Such observations in the inner magnetosphere for L < 3 have not yet been reported in the literature. This study offers two interesting case studies of observations of ULF waves by the low Earth orbiting CHAMP satellite. The magnetic field measurements from CHAMP, which are of unprecedented accuracy and resolution, are compared to Hermanus magnetometer data for times when CHAMP crosses the ground station L-shell, namely for 13 February 2002 and 18 February 2003. The data were analysed for Pc3 pulsation activity using the Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) method to visualise FLRs in the vector magnetometer data. For the first time observations of Pc3 toroidal oscillations with clearly L-dependent frequencies for lower L-shell values (L < 3) observed by an LEO satellite are reported. These observations show FLR frequencies increasing as a function of decreasing latitude down to L=1.6 and then decreasing as a result of the larger plasma density of the upper ionosphere. The L-dependent frequency oscillations were observed in the presence of a broadband compressional wave spectrum. Our observations thus confirm the well-known magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave theoretical prediction of a compressional wave being the driver of the field line resonance.

AB Whistlers observed at Dunedin, New Zealand, are an enigma since they do not conform to the classical model of whistler production developed by Storey (1953). It is generally accepted that the causative lightning stroke for a whistler observed on the ground at a particular location was located in the neighbourhood of the conjugate point, and generated an electromagnetic signal which propagated in a plasmaspheric duct stretched along a magnetic field line linking the two hemispheres. The causative stroke is thought to have occurred within reasonable proximity of one footpoint of this field line, while the observer was located in the vicinity of the other footpoint. Support for this model has come from a number of previous studies of whistler-lightning observations and whistler-induced particle precipitation. However, as demonstrated here, this model does not always apply.
   Whistlers detected at Dunedin are nearly as common as those at Tihany, Hungary, despite there being at least 3 orders of magnitude more lightning in Tihany's conjugate region compared to that of Dunedin. Furthermore, whereas Tihany whistlers are generally observed at night, consistent with historical observations, Dunedin whistlers occur predominantly during the day.
   This paper aims to resolve two paradoxes regarding whistler occurrence at Dunedin: (i) an observation rate which is at variance with conjugate lightning activity, and (ii) a diurnal occurrence peak during daylight. The technique developed by Collier et al. (2009) is used to diagnose the location of the source lightning for Dunedin whistlers. It is found that the majority of the causative strokes occur within a region extending down the west coast of Central America.

AB In this paper we develop the hydromagnetic wave equations for toroidal Alfven waves in a background axi-symmetric magnetic field. In the case where spatial variations are directed along the ambient magnetic field direction, the equations can be cast in a Klein-Gordon form in which the adiabatic-geometric amplitude factor of the perturbations varies as root rho L(5)sin(5)theta along a magnetic field line (where theta is colatitude and L the L-shell number) and the cutoff frequency, associated with the Klein-Gordon form, displays an astonishing variation with distance along a field line (see Eqs. 35 and 37 of the text), in the case of a dipole magnetic field. We compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Earth's dipole field which are relevant to geomagnetic pulsations.

AB The development of a map of the ionosphere over South Africa is presented in this paper. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model, South African Bottomside Ionospheric Model (SABIM), and measurements from ionosondes in the South African Ionosonde Network, were combined within their own limitations to develop an accurate representation of the South African ionosphere. The map is essentially in the form of a computer program that shows spatial and temporal representations of the South African ionosphere for a given set of geophysical parameters. A validation of the map is attempted using a comparison of Total Electron Content (TEC) values derived from the map, from the IRI model, and from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. It is foreseen that the final South African ionospheric map will be implemented as a Space Weather product of the African Space Weather Regional Warning Centre.

AB It is known that under certain solar wind (SW)/interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions (e.g. high SW speed, low cone angle) the occurrence of ground-level Pc3-4 pulsations is more likely. In this paper we demonstrate that in the event of anomalously low SW particle density, Pc3 activity is extremely low regardless of otherwise favourable SW speed and cone angle. We re-investigate the SW control of Pc3 pulsation activity through a statistical analysis and two empirical models with emphasis on the influence of SW density on Pc3 activity. We utilise SW and IMF measurements from the OMNI project and ground-based magnetometer measurements from the MM100 array to relate SW and IMF measurements to the occurrence of Pc3 activity. Multiple linear regression and artificial neural network models are used in iterative processes in order to identify sets of SW-based input parameters, which optimally reproduce a set of Pc3 activity data. The inclusion of SW density in the parameter set significantly improves the models. Not only the density itself, but other density related parameters, such as the dynamic pressure of the SW, or the standoff distance of the magnetopause work equally well in the model. The disappearance of Pc3s during low-density events can have at least four reasons according to the existing upstream wave theory: 1. Pausing the ion-cyclotron resonance that generates the upstream ultra low frequency waves in the absence of protons, 2. Weakening of the bow shock that implies less efficient reflection, 3. The SW becomes sub-Alfv,nic and hence it is not able to sweep back the waves propagating upstream with the Alfv,n-speed, and 4. The increase of the standoff distance of the magnetopause (and of the bow shock). Although the models cannot account for the lack of Pc3s during intervals when the SW density is extremely low, the resulting sets of optimal model inputs support the generation of mid latitude Pc3 activity predominantly through upstream waves.

AB In an attempt to determine the position and course of the horizontal trabecular column within the femoral neck a series of femoral necks were dissected using a physical method. Unexpectedly, the findings of the study show that the internal structure of the femoral neck, overall, is more complex than has been previously described.
   Both trabecular columns blend intimately with the overlying cortex in the manner of a composite structure, which may have implications as to their strength. It was noted, as previously described in the literature, that the horizontal column has a spiral configuration. In addition it was found, in this study, that this column shows wide variation in its inclination between different specimens. With increasing osteoporosis, the remnant of the horizontal column comes to lie progressively more antero-superiorly within the femoral neck. While fairly uniform in cross-sectional area throughout the femoral neck, this column is found to arise from a large, internal buttress within the upper anterior femoral shaft. It is also found that the femoral calcar, initially, has widespread attachments to all the internal structures.
   It is accepted that the formation of these trabeculae, and their retention with age, is due to the forces acting through them. The findings of the study, however, suggest that the horizontal trabeculae are responsible primarily for the conduction of compression forces, rather than tension forces as described in the Trajectorial Theory. A suggestion as to how the compression forces may be conducted through both these columns in the upper femur is given in light of the findings. These concepts, if proven, may require a modification of the approach to the biomechanical analysis of this region, particularly when using the various imaging techniques, as well as with physical testing of prostheses and other such hip devices.

AB Yam leaves were collected during surveys of major yam producing agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Ghana (n = 628) and Togo (n = 218) respectively, in 2005. Leaf tissues were tested for Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Dioscorea mottle virus (DMoV), Yam mild mosaic virus (YMMV), Yam mosaic virus (YMV) and badnaviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocapture-polymerase chain reaction (IC-PCR) and/or IC-reverse transcription-PCR (IC-RT-PCR). Eighty-one percent (370/459) and 78.9% (127/161) of symptomatic leaf samples from Ghana and Togo, respectively and 56.2% (95/169) and 57.9% (33/57) of non-symptomatic leaf samples, reacted positive to CMV, YMMV, YMV and/or badnaviruses, but DMoV was not detected. The highest incidence of YMV and badnaviruses was observed in the forest-savannah transition and Guinea savannah AEZ respectively in Ghana. In Togo, incidence of badnaviruses across the four AEZ ranged from 50 to 57.9%; however, Savane Derivee Seche AEZ had the highest incidence of badnaviruses (57.9%), YMV (34.2%) and CMV (7.9%). Mixed infection of badnaviruses and YMMV was the most frequent (105 of 276 mixed infections) in the two countries and Dioscorea alata was more heavily infected than D. rotundata in both countries.

AB Backgrounds/Aims: Prior to 1969, athletes were advised to avoid drinking during exercise. At least 4 subsequent events led to the adoption of a radically different approach. By 1996, all exercisers were advised to drink 'as much as tolerable' in order to insure that they did not lose any weight during exercise - the 'zero percent dehydration' doctrine. This advice requires that athletes drink enough to 'stay ahead of thirst'. The act of drinking is a basic survival instinct that has been regulated by complex, unconscious controls ever since the first fish-like creatures moved onto land and should not require conscious adjustment. Methods: Literature survey of all studies comparing the effects of drinking to thirst (ad libitum) and drinking to prevent any weight loss during exercise - the 'zero percent dehydration' doctrine. Result: No study found that drinking more than ad libitum during exercise produced any biological advantage, but it could cause exercise-associated hyponatremia. Conclusion: Drinking ad libitum appears to optimize performance and safety during exercise in many situations. The presence of thirst, not of water loss, may be the biological signal that impairs exercise performance in those who drink less than their thirst dictates during exercise. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess dermal exposure of cell workers to nickel at a South African base metal refinery and to characterize their skin condition by measuring the skin hydration and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) indices. Methods: The skin hydration index of the index finger, palm, neck, and forehead was measured before, during and at the end of the shift. The TEWL index was measured before and at the end of the shift. Dermal exposure samples were collected with Ghostwipes (TM) from the index finger and palm of the dominant hand, before, during, and at the end of the shift. Neck and forehead samples were collected before and at the end of the shift. Wipe samples of various surfaces in the workplace were also collected. Wipes were analyzed for nickel according to NIOSH method 9102, using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Results: Hydration indices measured on the hands decreased significantly during the shift, but recovered to normal levels by the end of the shift. TEWL indices for the index finger and palm of the hands are indicative of a low barrier function even before commencement of the shift, which further deteriorated significantly during the shift. During the shift, substantial nickel skin loading occurred on the index finger and palm of the hand. Levels on the neck and forehead were much lower. Various workplace surfaces, which workers come into contact with, were also contaminated with nickel. Conclusions: The skin condition and high levels of nickel on the skin were most probably caused by inadequate chemical protection provided by protective gloves. Although, the permeability of nickel through intact skin is considered to be low, a decreased barrier function of dehydrated or slightly damaged skin will increase its permeability for nickel. The ethnicity of these exposed workers may contribute significantly toward the low incidence of allergic contact dermatitis observed. Several measures to lower dermal exposure to nickel are also recommended.

   SEQUENCE DATA
AB We present a new generic classification of the largely Southern Henusphere grass subfamily Danthonouleae This classification is based on an almost completely sampled and well-resolved molecular phylogeny and on a complete morphological data set We have attempted to delimit munophveltic genera (complicated by the presence of apparent intergeneric hybridization), which are diagnosable as well as morphologically and ecogengraphically coherent We recognize 17 genera, including five new genera (Austroderia N P Barker & H P Linder. Capeochloa H P Linder & N P Barker. Chimaetochloa H P Linder. Geochloa H P Linder & N P Barker and Tenaxia N P Barker & H P linder), and two (Nees) H P Linder & Galley) Of the remaining 12 genera. the deluminations of sevea are changed Merimuellera Coned is much reduced by the segregation of Geochloa. Caperochloa and Tenaxia. Pentameris is expanded to include Prionanthium Desv and Pentaschistis (Nees) Spach. Cortaderia Stapf is expanded by the inclusion of Lamprothyrus Pilg, but reduced by the segregation of its New Zeland species into the new genus Austroderia a large Rytidosperma Steud is assembled out of loycea H P Linder. Austrodanthonta H P Linder. Notodanthoma Zotov. Erythranthera Zotov. Pyrrhanthera Zotov and Monostachva merr, and the species previously assigned to Karroochloa Conert & Turpe. Schismus P Beauv, Urochlaena Nees, and Tribolium Desv have been reassigned to only two genera Finally, the Himalavan species of Danthonia DC are transfered to Tenaxia and the remaining African species of Danthania to Mervmuellera The 281 species that we recognize in the subfamily 100 necessary new combinations include Mervinuellera grandiflora (Hoehst ev A Rich) H P Lander, Geochlou decora (Nees) N P Barker & H P Lander.

AB In a recent study in northern South Africa, the seroprevalence of Entamoeba histolytica infection among 257 HIV-positive and 117 HIV-negative individuals was determined, using an ELISA for the detection of antibodies reacting with the parasite's galactose/-acetyl-D-galactosamine(Gal/GalNAc)-inhibitable adherence lectin. Overall, 34.0% of the 374 participants (36.1% of the females and 28.1% of the males) were found seropositive for E. histolytica. Although all age-groups were affected by the amoebic pathogen, the subjects aged 50-59 years had the highest seroprevalence (69.2%). The seroprevalence of E. histolytica was also significantly higher among the HIV-positive subjects than among the HIV-negative (42.8% v. 14.5%; chi(2) = 28.65; P < 0.0001). Among the HIV-positive subjects, those with fewer than 200 CD4+ cells/mu l were relatively more likely to be seropositive for E. histolytica (60.3% v. 43.8%; chi(2) = 4.016; P = 0.045). This is the first report indicating a positive association between E. histolytica infection and HIV in South Africa. Further studies, for example to determine the occurrence of diarrhoea or liver abscess in the study area, in relation to seropositivity for E. histolytica and/or HIV, are now needed.

AB Exotic plants provide a unique opportunity to explore the evolution of defense allocation in plants. Many studies have focused on whether enemy release leads to a change in defense allocation. Little research has focused on induced defenses and on how resource availability in the nonindigenous range might cause evolutionary shifts in defense trait allocation. We examine (a) the major evolutionary hypotheses predicting defense expression in plants, (b) the hypotheses explaining defense evolution of exotic species, and (c) the importance of geographic variation in ecological interactions to defense evolution (geographic mosaics). In addition, we review the strengths and weaknesses of experimental approaches, present case studies, and suggest areas that deserve further attention.

AB Invasive species are a major element of global change and are contributing to biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and impairment of ecosystem services worldwide. Research is shedding new light on the ecological and economic consequences of invasions. New approaches are emerging for describing and evaluating impacts of invasive species, and for translating these impacts into monetary terms. The harmful effects of invasions are now widely recognized, and multiscale programs are in place in many parts of the world to reduce current and future impacts. There has been an upsurge in scientific research aimed at guiding management interventions. Among the activities that are receiving the most attention and that have the most promise for reducing problems are risk assessment, pathway and vector management, early detection, rapid response, and new approaches to mitigation and restoration. Screening protocols to reduce new introductions are becoming more accurate and have been shown cost-effective.

AB The juncture of human rights and policing is a relatively recent field of scholarship. It tends to explain the relationship between policing and human rights as one of exigency and necessity, culminating in the idea of police as human rights defenders. An ethnographically rich scholarship on policing has emerged both as a critical response to these assumptions and out of an awareness of the impossible but nevertheless central role that policing has come to play in a neoliberal age. This critical scholarship takes the juncture of policing and human rights as a historically specific phenomenon and enables us to understand many of its contingencies. It reintegrates the normative presuppositions of human rights policing as societal facts among other societal facts and points to how human rights and policing enable and foreclose new ways of ordering society and bring about particular articulations of biopolitics with assertions of sovereignty.

AB South Africa became a constitutional democracy in 1994. This article reviews the first 15 years of constitutional jurisprudence produced by the country's first Constitutional Court. While the court interpreted the Constitution to eradicate racist, sexist, and homophobic legislation and similar common law rules, it did little to promote a comprehensive transformation of the legal system and thus the patterns of distribution that were supported by the law. This is illustrated particularly in the area of social and economic rights. The conclusion is thus reached that the new legal foundations are insufficiently resilient to hold the weight of constitutional expectation.

AB Starch is the most widespread and abundant storage carbohydrate in plants. We depend upon starch for our nutrition, exploit its unique properties in industry, and use it as a feedstock for bioethanol production. Here, we review recent advances in research in three key areas. First, we assess progress in identifying the enzymatic machinery required for the synthesis of amylopectin, the glucose polymer responsible for the insoluble nature of starch. Second, we discuss the pathways of starch degradation, focusing on the emerging role of transient glucan phosphorylation in plastids as a mechanism for solubilizing the surface of the starch granule. We contrast this pathway in leaves with the degradation of starch in the endosperm of germinated cereal seeds. Third, we consider the evolution of starch biosynthesis in plants from the ancestral ability to make glycogen. Finally, we discuss how this basic knowledge has been utilized to improve and diversify starch crops.

AB Following a discursive approach, this paper introduces a school intended for sick learners; one that is regarded as an institution that promotes good mothering, and where the attending girls are cured of being 'sick' with child. The paper aims to open a window on the socio-economic circumstances, religious ideals and norms amongst some Afrikaans-speaking people. This takes place within a wider framework of shedding light on broader issues in contemporary South Africa. Based on information generated through ethnographic methods, the paper shows how the school in question attempts to perpetuate ideas of a 'good white' and a 'good mother' as part of a discourse of ordentlikheid. The paper concludes speculative remarks on the appearance of this ordentlikheid discourse in political statements about teenage pregnancy.

TI Memory, landscape and event: How Ndebele labour tenants interpret and
   reclaim the past
SO ANTHROPOLOGY SOUTHERN AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Memory; land; landscape; labour tenants; Ndebele; mnemonics; land claims
AB The article discusses the roots of memory of former Ndebele labour tenants, and how these memories manifest in landscape, object and event. Recognising the role of history that bound most of the Ndundza community into labour tenancy, the author unpacks the manner in which they articulate the past through their physical and intangible environments. A range of factors influence the quality of memory, as is illustrated through the narratives of some of these labour tenants. The Ndebele also display unique ways of remembering past chronologies and they are able to weave these into both everyday and traumatic events. The application of memory becomes contested in current land claims, and memory might be sacrificed in the process.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Anthropologists are increasingly interested in the reception and adaptation of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) at the local level, especially when these are intended or adapted for social change in the kinds of societies and communities anthropologists study. The process has been increasingly driven by the spread of landline telephones, radio, television, personal computers, the Internet (1.0 and now 2.0), basic cell phones and now internet-enabled or '3G' cell phones. These successive technological innovations, now collectively grouped as ICTs, have had the effect of shrinking distance by increasing the reach of both those who control these technologies and those who can access them. With radio and TV, and even the Internet until recently, communication tended to be one-way: from the centre to the periphery both between and within countries. This was never the case with landline telephones, which offered two-way communication from the outset; but landlines rarely extended into the rural areas of developing countries, and even where there was access, the poor generally could not afford domestic installation. Cellular phones, though even more expensive in terms of call charges, operate beyond the reach of landlines, are portable and no longer as dependent on frequent charging from mains electricity as before. The wireless networks that run them now offer access to the Internet almost everywhere - for those who have 3G handsets and/or wireless-connected computers - and include such useful adaptations to Third World conditions such as 'pay as you go' and 'please call me.' Moreover, the Internet itself has become more interactive with its 2.0 technologies. If 'development' (as opposed to modernisation) is about agency and empowerment for those who currently lack it, then there is development potential in the newest ICTs despite their control by major multinational corporations. Informatics professionals and elements of the 'development community' reaching as high as the World Bank and the United Nations (Millennium Development Goals) regard ICT4D (ICTs for development) as a potential redeemer of half a century of mostly failed interventions on behalf of the world's poor. But how feasible is ICT4D? How is it being received and what are its direct and indirect impacts? This paper is the outcome of four years of engagement with an ICT4D research project founded in Dwesa-Cwebe on the Wild Coast of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. It assesses not only the potential and snags of ICT as a development tool, but also, via a baseline research project completed in 2008, provides a sense of the setting, the needs of the community and the potential of the 'Living Lab' approach to ICT4D.

TI 'Don't "paraffin" me!': deception, power and agency in a South African
   sport for development organisation
SO ANTHROPOLOGY SOUTHERN AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE South Africa; non-government organisation (NGO); deceit; lying; role
   conflict; power; agency; paraffin
ID LANGUAGE; CORRUPTION
AB The staff of Sport FUNdamentals Southern Africa (SFSA), a sport for development organisation, have labelled a range of deceitful behaviours 'paraffining'. These behaviours range from improvising life skills lessons to lying in reports. It references paraffin, a common, yet potentially dangerous fuel used in South African townships. In this paper the striking similarities between 'paraffin', the innovative verb, and paraffin, the familiar noun, are examined, highlighting their uses, reasons for usage, impacts and methods of control. As individuals encounter role conflicts between their job expectations and personal capabilities or available resources, between personal and professional roles or conflicting expectations from different managers, they often respond by 'paraffining'. In these situations, 'paraffining' can be seen as a creative coping mechanism used to maintain the appearance of professional proficiency. 'Paraffining' also demonstrates individual power and agency within organisational structures since it provides a platform for individuals to confront deceitful situations with people at all levels of authority and pressures the organisation to implement measures to reduce their prevalence.

AB The concept of 'Ethnicity, Inc.' so thoroughly conjoins the ethnic nation with the ethnic corporation that it becomes increasingly difficult to think of one without the other. This article aims to deconstruct this relationship by demonstrating how the ambiguity between nation and corporation affords Bafokeng, Inc. several beneficial statuses. Power brokers play the boundaries, skilfully blending, equivocating, mediating, and otherwise working the spheres of nation and corporation, of bureaucracy and market. The strength of Ethnicity, Inc. organisations lies in significant part in their ability to adopt different statuses in the context of a politics of recognition and representation.

TI Rural people's perceptions of wildlife conservation - the case of the
   Masebe Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province, South Africa
SO ANTHROPOLOGY SOUTHERN AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Langa Ndebele; Masebe Nature Reserve; nature conservation; perceptions;
   management; environmental education; poaching; financial benefits
AB The First World rationale for nature conservation is usually the aesthetic and recreational experiences and opportunities that nature provides and its scientific importance, but rural populations in Africa tend to focus on the utilisation of natural resources. This paper argues that management decisions regarding the conservation and utilisation of natural resources are inseparable from a people's world view and value system, because values inform people's ideas about useful or valuable resources, appropriate behaviour and their priorities regarding issues such as grazing, hunting versus poaching, job creation, tourism, and access to sacred sites and natural resources.
   The objective of this study was to gain insight into the perceptions of wildlife conservation among the North Ndebele in Limpopo Province to create a climate in which the community can become involved in issues regarding policy matters and the management of the Masebe Nature Reserve.

AB Since the first European settlements in what is now South Africa, various factors have, over centuries, contributed to the near destruction of the social structures, cohesion and identities of the broader Khoekhoe and San communities of the country. The last few years, however, have seen ethnic mobilisation and the creation and establishment of new political structures among people claiming Khoekhoe or San descent. Many revival movements have sprung up across the country, some of which are spearheaded by self-appointed leaders who mobilise support on ethnic grounds. The claims of origin prompted strong criticism both from within the ranks of the Khoekhoe and San, as well as from academics. This article focuses on some of the revival processes among Griqua and Korona in Heidedal. Ethnographic material from Heidedal indicates that the processes differ in terms of preamble, agenda and type of leadership. It also shows that the use of the names 'Griqua' and 'Korana' remains controversial and unstable, and that at this stage it would be problematic to apply the notion of 'ethnic group' to the people referred to by these attributes without qualification.

ID OXALIC-ACID; BEHAVIOR; PHASES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to supplement the scant previous investigations on the corrosion behaviour of 2205 and 2507 duplex stainless steels in selected organic acids containing chloride additions.
   Design/methodology/approach - Microstructural examination of the alloys was first carried out, after which the corrosion behaviour of the alloys in citric, oxalic, formic and acetic acids containing chloride additions at varying temperatures was studied using electrochemical techniques.
   Findings - The alloy 2507 material had a larger grain size than did the alloy 2205 sample. The corrosion resistances of the alloys generally are highest in acetic acids and lowest in citric acid. The addition of chloride had a pronounced effect on their corrosion resistance. Alloy 2507 generally exhibited higher corrosion resistance in all of the acids than alloy 2205, with the exception of acetic acid at room temperature. The 50:50 ratio of ferrite to austenite composition, as revealed by phase compositional analysis, indicated no significant possibility for galvanic corrosion between the phases. This suggests that the corrosion behaviour of the alloys is controlled by their grain sizes and chemical compositions.
   Originality/value - Although the corrosion behaviour of duplex stainless steels in some organic acid media has been reported, this investigation covers the major organic acids not previously reported. Since in real industrial systems a mixture of both organic and minerals acids/salts may typically exist, investigations of the combined effect of chloride ions with the organic acids reported in this paper typify real industrial operations. The paper thus provides a basis for material selection for the application of 2205 and 2507 in industrial systems where organic acids are mostly used.

TI Structure of the Heme Biosynthetic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   Porphobilinogen Synthase in Complex with the Antibiotic Alaremycin

LA English

AB The recently discovered antibacterial compound alaremycin, produced by Streptomyces sp. A012304, structurally closely resembles 5-aminolevulinic acid, the substrate of porphobilinogen synthase. During the initial steps of heme biosynthesis, two molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid are asymmetrically condensed to porphobilinogen. Alaremycin was found to efficiently inhibit the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Using the newly created heme-permeable strain Escherichia coli CSA1, we are able to uncouple heme biosynthesis from bacterial growth and demonstrate that alaremycin targets the heme biosynthetic pathway. Further studies focused on the activity of alaremycin against the opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC of alaremycin was determined to be 12 mM. Alaremycin was identified as a direct inhibitor of recombinant purified P. aeruginosa porphobilinogen synthase and had a K(i) of 1.33 mM. To understand the molecular basis of alaremycin's antibiotic activity at the atomic level, the P. aeruginosa porphobilinogen synthase was cocrystallized with the alaremycin. At 1.75-angstrom resolution, the crystal structure reveals that the antibiotic efficiently blocks the active site of porphobilinogen synthase. The antibiotic binds as a reduced derivative of 5-acetamido-4-oxo-5-hexenoic acid. The corresponding methyl group is, however, not coordinated by any amino acid residues of the active site, excluding its functional relevance for alaremycin inhibition. Alaremycin is covalently bound by the catalytically important active-site lysine residue 260 and is tightly coordinated by several active-site amino acids. Our data provide a solid structural basis to further improve the activity of alaremycin for rational drug design. Potential approaches are discussed.

AB Part of what makes the current conjuncture so extraordinary is the coincidence of the massive economic meltdown with the implosion of the neoconservative Project for a New American Century, and the reappearance of US liberal internationalism in the guise of "smart power" defined in terms of Diplomacy, Development, and Defence. This essay engages these challenges through a framework that distinguishes between "Development" as a post-war international project that emerged in the context of decolonization and the Cold War, and capitalist development as a dynamic and highly uneven process of creation and destruction. Closely attentive to what Gramsci calls "the relations of force at various levels", my task in this essay is to suggest how the instabilities and constant redefinitions of official discourses and practices of Development since the 1940s shed light on the conditions in which we now find ourselves.

AB Background: Little is known about pregnancy patterns and levels of HIV RNA in HIV-infected women conceiving on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with non-suppressed viral load (VL), nor about their therapeutic management.
   Methods: Linear mixed models were fitted to study changes in VL and potential associated factors including HAART type or duration and immune status among 127 women receiving HAART at conception with detectable VL enrolled in the prospective European Collaborative Study.
   Results: Median duration of HAART at conception was 10 months. A total of 78 (61%) women conceived while on protease inhibitor (PO-based HAART. Overall, 72 (57%) women remained on the same HAART regimen throughout pregnancy, 24 (19%) switched regimens and 31 (24%) interrupted HAART during early pregnancy. The intention-to-treat model indicated constant VL up to 10 gestational weeks; thereafter, levels decreased significantly, by 0.06 logic, copies/ml weekly until delivery. At baseline, immune status was significantly associated with HIV RNA levels. Excluding those with treatment interruption, there was no significant difference in VL slope between women who did and did not modify their HAART regimens (P=0.14); women conceiving on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based HAART had consistently lower VL throughout pregnancy than those on PI-based HAART (P=0.02). Most (64/103, 62%) women had detectable VL within 4 weeks of delivery (median 2.40 log(10) copies/ml). The overall mother-to-child transmission rate was 1.72% (95% confidence interval 0.21-6.1).
   Conclusions: Practices regarding management of women conceiving on HAART with detectable VL vary in Western Europe. The existence of this group of pregnant women highlights the need for improved monitoring of and support for treated women before they become pregnant, as well as during pregnancy.

AB Background: A causal relationship exists between HBV infection and membranous nephropathy. The association is especially close in Black children in sub-Saharan Africa. Interferon-alpha 2b is commonly used to treat this condition, but is effective in only 30-40% of patients. The reason for the poor response is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if mutations in the surface gene of HBV isolated from Black children with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy before, during and after interferon treatment, have any effect on treatment response and vice versa.
   Methods: HBV DNA was extracted from a responder, a reverter and a non-responder before and after initiation of 16 weeks of interferon-alpha 2b treatment. The preS1/preS2/S region was amplified, cloned and sequenced.
   Results: The preS2 region was the most variable in the reverter and the non-responder, and the S region was the most variable in the non-responder. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viral population dynamics between the responder and the reverter/non-responder strains differed as a result of mutations in the surface gene.
   Conclusions: The presence of mutations in the S region of HBV could be used as predictive markers to differentiate interferon-a2b responders from non-responders provided that detailed analysis of further genomes confirms our findings.

ID B-VIRUS-INFECTION; OCCULT HEPATITIS-B; LAMIVUDINE-RESISTANCE;
   BLACK-CHILDREN; PREVALENCE
AB There are approximately 33 million individuals with HIV infection worldwide. The majority of infections are in southern Africa where hepatitis B is also known to be endemic. As access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases, the possibility for hepatitis B treatment resistance increases because most ART regimens contain lamivudine. Patients coinfected with HBV are therefore receiving monotherapy for HBV infection, leading to possible HBV-resistant mutants and the concurrent public health effect thereof. Additional information is needed on the prevalence of HIV-HBV coinfection and treatment response to ART. We present a summary of the information available from South Africa to date.

AB Background: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the unique member of the Asfarviridae family and Asfivirus genus. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA arbovirus that replicates in the cell cytoplasm, similar to poxviruses. There is no vaccine and no treatment available to control this virus.
   Methods: We describe the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the A151R and VP72 (B646L) genes to control the ASFV replication in vitro.
   Results: Results suggest that siRNA targeting the A151R and VP72 genes can reduce both the virus replication and its levels of messenger RNA transcripts. The reduction was up to 4 log(10) copies on the virus titre and up to 3 log(10) copies on virus RNA transcripts levels. The combination of multiple siRNA did not improve the antiviral effect significantly, compared with use of individual siRNAs.
   Conclusions: The function of the A151R gene product in the virus replication cycle is yet unclear, but is essential. We also demonstrate that it is possible to inhibit, using small interfering RNA, a virus that replicates exclusively in the cell cytoplasm in specific viral factories.

TI Antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy: balancing the risk of preterm
   delivery with prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission
SO ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
ID LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; INFECTED WOMEN; HIV-1-INFECTED WOMEN; UNITED-KINGDOM;
   IRELAND; PROPHYLAXIS; MORTALITY; TOXICITY; OUTCOMES; DISEASE
AB Background: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for pregnant HIV-positive women reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission, but is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). We aimed to quantify the incremental risk-benefit ratio for HAART compared with zidovudine monotherapy with respect to these outcomes.
   Methods: Two-stage Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to estimate the risk-benefit ratio for HAART in pregnancy. Estimates of mother-to-child transmission and preterm delivery rates were obtained from UK and Ireland surveillance data collected through the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood.
   Results: At a population level, HAART was associated with a more than sevenfold reduction in mother-to-child transmission compared with zidovudine monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.27), but with a 1.4-fold increased odds of preterm delivery (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) and twofold increased odds of severe preterm delivery (<32 weeks; AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.09-3.88). The incremental risk-benefit ratio for HAART in pregnancy compared with monotherapy was 0.63 (95% simulation interval 0.06-1.96) additional preterm births and 0.23 (95% simulation interval -0.02-0.88) severe preterm births for each infection prevented.
   Conclusions: It is estimated that for every 100 HIV transmissions prevented through the use of HAART (rather than monotherapy), 63 additional preterm deliveries would occur, including 23 at <32 weeks gestation. Interpretation of these ratios is context-dependent and requires additional information about morbidity, mortality and costs associated with the outcomes.

TI The invasive 'mothcatcher' (Araujia sericifera Brot.; Asclepiadoideae)
   co-opts native honeybees as its primary pollinator in South Africa
SO AOB PLANTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background and aims Successful invasive plants such as Araujia sericifera usually either are capable of automatic self-pollination or maintain pollinator services by having generalized pollination systems to make use of local pollinators in the invaded range. Alternatively, plants must co-opt new pollinators with similar morphology to native pollinators or reproduce asexually. We aimed to document the pollination biology of A. sericifera in South Africa. Given the success of this species as an invader, we predicted that sexual reproduction occurs either through self-pollination or because A. sericifera has successfully co-opted native insect pollinators.
   Methodology We examined the pollination biology of the South American A. sericifera in South Africa. We documented the effective pollinators including a comparison of the efficacy of nocturnal versus diurnal pollinators as well as the breeding system and long-term natural levels of the pollination success of this species.
   Principal results We found that native honeybees (Apis mellifera) were the main pollinators of A. sericifera in South Africa. Visiting moths are unimportant pollinators despite being attracted by the pale colour and nocturnal scent of the flowers. Plants from the Grahamstown population were incapable of autonomous self-pollination but pollinator-mediated self-pollination does occur. However, the highest fruit initiation resulted from out-crossed pollination treatments. The high pollen transfer efficiency of this species was comparable to other hymenopteran-pollinated exotic and native milkweeds, suggesting that A. sericifera maintains pollinator services at levels experienced by indigenous asclepiad species.
   Conclusions Araujia sericifera reproduces successfully in South Africa due to a combined ability of this species to attract and exploit native honeybees as its pollinators and of individual plants to set fruit from pollinator-mediated self-pollination.

AB Background: Deficits of executive function (EF) have been proposed as all or part of the underlying mechanisms of language impairment in at least some types of aphasia. Executive functions also play a role in the recovery process. There is evidence that bilingual persons have some executive functioning advantages compared to monolingual persons. In this paper we combine two lines of recent investigation in order to explore the relationship between executive function and conversational strategies in bilingual aphasia. Aims: The aim of this preliminary research was to compare the executive functioning profiles of bilingual individuals to those of monolingual participants with aphasia. A further aim was to examine evidence in the conversational samples of the participants in relation to the application of a range of executive skills and to link cognitive and conversational profiles using Barkley's (1997) model of executive functions. Methods Procedures: The performance of two bilingual individuals with aphasia on a test battery of executive function tests was compared with that of eight monolingual persons (seven with aphasia and one with right hemisphere damage). The test battery included measures of behavioural inhibition, working memory, problem solving, and reconstitution. The presence or absence of executive features in the conversational samples of the participants was judged by four raters using conversational analysis methods. Outcomes Results: Significant differences were found between the scores of the bilingual participants and those of the monolingual participants on measures of behavioural inhibition, working memory, planning and problem solving, and reconstitution. The bilingual participants' scores were mostly within normal limits and suggested well-retained executive functions. Conversation analysis showed evidence of differential application of these executive functions to conversational management. Regardless of severity or type of aphasia, the bilingual participants showed evidence of good topic management, repair, and flexibility compared to the monolingual participants. Conclusions: The results are interpreted in relation to current issues in bilingualism. Our preliminary findings shed light on differential approaches to assessment, therapy, and choice of language for bilingual aphasia.

AB The transmission of honeybee pathogens by free-flying pests, such as small hive beetles (=SHB), would be independent of bees and beekeepers and thereby constitute a new challenge for pathogen control measures. Here we show that larval and adult SHB become contaminated with Paenibacillus larvae spores when exposed to honeybee brood combs with clinical American foulbrood (=AFB) symptoms in the laboratory. This contamination persists in pupae and newly emerged adults. After exposure to contaminated adult SHB, honeybee field colonies showed higher numbers of P. larvae spores in worker and honey samples after five weeks. Despite these results, the rather low number of P. larvae spores on adult SHB suggests that clinical AFB outbreaks are not likely. However, even small spore numbers can be sufficient to spread P. larvae. Therefore, our data clearly show that SHB are vectors of P. larvae. We suggest considering the role of SHB in AFB control in areas where both pests are established.

AB The retinue behavior of worker bees of Apis cerana cerana and Apis mellifera ligustica in two types of mixed-species colonies were studied to determine whether observed behaviors are pre- or post-speciation developments. In A. cerana queen-led mixed colonies, almost equal numbers of A. cerana workers (53.4 +/- 7.4) and A. mellifera workers (51.2 +/- 8.1) attended the A. cerana queen; while in A. mellifera queen-led mixed colonies, the A. mellifera queen attracted significantly fewer (47.8 +/- 5.9) A. cerana workers than A. mellifera workers (51.9 +/- 4.6). Thus about 100 workers in total were attracted to each queen. In pure A. cerana and A. mellifera colonies, the queen attracted 105.8 +/- 9.1 and 107.8 +/- 11.2 workers, respectively, there being no significant difference between them. Only the pheromones 9-ODA, 9-HDA and 10-HDA of the queens were significantly different and the workers did not show avoidance behavior to either heterospecific queen. Both species of workers were attracted by the queens and engaged in retinue behavior, suggesting that the retinue response was not related to a specific queen pheromone or colony environment. This non-specific queen retinue behavior in the mixed colonies indicates that the queen pheromones can be transmitted among the workers from the two species without any obstacles. We conclude that retinue behavior itself as well as the pheromones of the queens that induce this behavior are both primitive, conserved traits that preceded speciation in apine bees.

AB Pollen is the natural source of protein for bees and it is commonly assumed that a high protein content in pollen is beneficial. Investigation of the optimal nutrient ratio for honeybees was prompted by our earlier study showing surprisingly high mortality in caged honeybees fed with the protein-rich pollen of Aloe greatheadii var davyana, although field bees experience optimal growth when feeding on this pollen. We tested the effect of different protein sources and different protein: carbohydrate (P:C) ratios on the survival and ovarian activation of caged bees. Bees fed casein showed consistently higher survival than those fed royal jelly or aloe pollen, regardless of P:C ratios. They survived longer on lower P:C ratios and longest on a pure carbohydrate diet. The greatest ovarian activation was recorded for bees fed royal jelly in a 1:3 P:C ratio, showing the superior quality of royal jelly for supporting development.

AB We consider a compartmental model for the Bartonella infection on rodents. More precisely, on the co-occurring populations of Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus where the vectors are two species of ectoparasites, namely ticks and fleas. As usual for such models a key stage is the modelling of the forces of infection. While the vital dynamics and the progression of the infection within each of the four species are sufficiently well known to determine the rest of the transfer rates, there is practically no data on the probability of infection. In order to determine appropriate values for the coefficients of the forces of infection we solve an optimal control problem where the objective function is the norm of the difference between the observed and the predicted by the model equilibrium infection prevalence rates in the four species. Within this setting the conjecture that the higher prevalence of the infection in Rattus norvegicus can be explained solely by their higher ectoparasite load is tested and disproved.

AB This paper investigates the hydromagnetic stagnation flow of an incompressible viscous, electrically conducting fluid, towards a stretching sheet in the presence of axially increasing free stream velocity. The newton-Raphson shooting method, along with fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration algorithm, are employed to tackle the third order, nonlinear boundary layer equation governing the problem. The variational iteration method (VIM), coupled with Fade technique is also applied for a reliable treatment of the problem. The study shows that the series solution is obtained without restrictions on the nonlinearity behavio. The solutions are compared with the other available results in the literature, and a good agreement is found.

AB This article examines econometric relationships between bank lending and business cycle in South Africa. Two long-run economic relationships are hypothesized between total credit and the variables, namely, coincidental indicators, spread between lending and borrowing rates, money supply, stock price index, inflation and banking sector specific factors included in the model. Of these variables, only coincident indicators, changes in money supply as well as capital, and reserve are found to exert some influence on short-run total credit availability.

AB In sexual strategies theory (SST), risky behaviour such as crime is the outcome of males' sexual reproduction strategies. Using panel data from South Africa, one of the countries with the highest crime rates in the world, a random-effects GLS regression finds support for the SST as an explanation for violent crime.

TI A note on the subprime mortgage crisis: dynamic modelling of bank
   leverage profit under loan securitization
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this brief research article, we consider the financial modelling of the process of mortgage loan securitization that has been a root cause of the ongoing Subprime Mortgage Crisis (SMC). In particular, we suggest a Levy process-driven model of bank leverage profit that arises from the securitization of a pool of subprime mortgage loans. To achieve this, we develop stochastic models for mortgage loans, mortgage loan losses, credit ratings and mortgage loan guarantees in a subprime context. These models incorporate some of the most important issues related to the SMC and its causes. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of the models developed earlier in our contribution and its relationship with the SMC.

AB The historical and deductive merits for an explicit energy-based economic growth formulation are presented. Parameters in the formulation are successfully calibrated to empirical data and a range of forecasts is made for global economic growth potential to 2050, based on a plausible case of energy availability. The results demonstrate the vital importance of energy security and lead to the conclusion that the current socio-economic paradigm may not be sustainable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2008, South Africa experienced a severe electricity crisis. Domestic and industrial electricity users had to suffer from black outs all over the country. It is argued that partially the reason was the lack of research on energy, locally. However, Eskom argues that the lack of capacity can only be solved by building new power plants.
   The objective of this study is to specify the variables that explain the electricity demand in South Africa and to forecast electricity demand by creating a model using the Engle-Granger methodology for co-integration and Error Correction models. By producing reliable results, this study will make a significant contribution that will improve the status quo of energy research in South Africa.
   The findings indicate that there is a long run relationship between electricity consumption and price as well as economic growth/income. The last few years in South Africa, price elasticity was rarely taken into account because of the low and decreasing prices in the past. The short-run dynamics of the system are affected by population growth, too.
   After the energy crisis, Eskom, the national electricity supplier, is in search for substantial funding in order to build new power plants that will help with the envisaged lack of capacity that the company experienced. By using two scenarios for the future of growth, this study shows that the electricity demand will drop substantially due to the price policies agreed - until now - by Eskom and the National Energy Regulator South Africa (NERSA) that will affect the demand for some years.

AB We present a model for osmotic pressure and shear modulus of highly concentrated emulsions by including the interdroplet interaction in terms of disjoining pressure. The results show that even a small addition in interdroplet interaction can lead to significant deviations from the classical Princen-Lacasse-Mason models that take into account only the surface energy as the sole source of elasticity. The newly proposed model predicts new effects, in particular the possibility of nonlinear dependency of elastic modulus on the droplet size, and can be used to discuss the elasticity sources of highly concentrated emulsions. In the second part of this article, the unusual elasticity of highly concentrated explosive emulsions is discussed by using the proposed model.

AB Green luminescence and degradation of Ce(3+) doped CaS nanocrystalline phosphors were studied with a 2 keV, 10 mu A electron beam in an O(2) environment. The nanophosphors were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy, Scanning electron microscopy/electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Cubic CaS with an average particle size of 42 +/- 2 nm was obtained. PL emission was observed at 507 nm and a shoulder at 560 nm with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. Auger electron spectroscopy and Cathodoluminescence (CL) were used to monitor the changes in the surface composition of the CaS:Ce(3+) nanocrystalline phosphors during electron bombardment in an O(2) environment. The effect of different oxygen pressures ranging from 1 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-6) Torr on the CL intensity was also investigated. A CaSO(4) layer was observed on the surface after the electron beam degradation. The CL intensity was found to decrease up to 30% of its original intensity at 1 x 10(-6) Torr oxygen pressure after an electron dose of 50 C/cm(2). The formation of oxygen defects during electron bombardment may also be responsible for the decrease in CL intensity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The average ablation depth per pulse of silver foil by 130 fs laser pulses has been measured in vacuum over a range of three orders of magnitude of pulse fluence up to 900 J cm(-2). In addition, double pulses with separations up to 3.4 ns have been used to probe time scales of relevance for femtosecond ablation. The double pulse ablation depth, when each pulse fluence is 0.7 J cm(-2), falls to that of a single pulse as the pulse separation is increased from 0 ps to 700 ps. This time scale decreases to only 4 ps as the fluence is increased to 11 J cm(-2). It then jumps to 500 ps across a transition fluence where the slope of the ablation depth versus logarithmic fluence characteristic changes abruptly to a higher value. In addition, for pulse separations near 1000 ps, the second pulse can cause re-deposition of ejecta from the first pulse resulting in a double pulse ablation depth only 40% that of the first pulse alone. This has important implications for the interpretation of double pulse femto-LIBS intensities. Our results suggest that the optical properties of nano or mesoparticles play a significant role in double pulse ablation with large pulse separations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Growth estimates for shark species are mostly derived from length-at-age data, where age information is commonly obtained from hard structures such as vertebrae and dorsal-fin spines. Unfortunately, hard structures cannot be used for estimating the age of many shark species, particularly those occurring in deep water or belonging to ancient groups. Alternative methods are therefore required for the estimation of growth for these shark groups. The broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus has very poorly calcified vertebrae that cannot be used for age and growth estimations. Three stochastic versions of the von Bertalanffy-Fabens growth model with random parameter k were fitted to length-increment data of captive and of wild tagged and recaptured N. cepedianus from southeastern Australia, California and southern Africa. The model based on a gamma distributed parameter k provided the best fit to the data. Captive females and wild females showed the highest and lowest values of mathematical expectation E[k], whereas wild males and wild females showed the lowest and highest values of mean maximum length L-infinity, respectively. For a time interval of 1. yr, captive females had the highest length increment, whereas wild females had the lowest length increment. Our approach allows accounting for the natural heterogeneity of growth in the estimation of the growth parameters of N. cepedianus, which has not been done previously for captive and wild sharks. This the first study to provide a representative set of growth parameters for male and female N. cepedianus, which is crucial information for the modelling of the population dynamics of this top predator.

AB The Zambezi River has a catchment area of 1.32 million km(2), including parts of eight countries. Three divisions of the river are recognised: the Upper Zambezi separated from the Middle Zambezi by Victoria Falls, and the Lower Zambezi below Cahora Bassa gorge. The Okavango River is also linked to the Upper Zambezi system in wet years in an area of complex geomorphological history. Habitats include forested headwater streams, extensive floodplains, deep gorges, two large man-made lakes and an extensive delta. On floodplains, subsistence fisheries exploit the natural seasonal cycles, while the man-made lakes have commercial-scale fisheries for introduced kapenta, Limnothrissa miodon. Aquaculture is on a small scale, though with larger commercial cage culture enterprises on Lake Kariba. This paper summarises current knowledge on the fish faunas and their origins, the status of the different fisheries and their management, and the conservation status of the river's resources.

AB Lake Malawi's fishes are a source of food for millions and provide a livelihood for thousands by encouraging tourism, fascinating the scientific fraternity, enchanting aquarists around the world and maintaining ecosystem processes in the lake. From a fisheries and resource assessment perspective, the region is data-poor, but there is sufficient peer-reviewed and grey literature on the limnology, fisheries and ichthyofauna of the lake to provide a good overview of the state of the fishery. There are signs of over exploitation and an increasing fishing effort has resulted in decreased catch rates, depletion of larger, more valuable species in the fishery and species changes. The fishery is harvesting stocks that were formerly thought to be under exploited. Previous attempts to manage the fishery have been ineffective and long term strategies addressing overfishing will need to transform the fishery from an open-access to a limited access system. As important as direct intervention in the management of the fisheries, will be the management of catchment processes. Increased nutrient inputs; changes to the phytoplankton composition; sediment loading; nearshore water quality impacts and changing water levels threaten the ecosystem. Introduction of alien invasive organisms is an ever present threat to the ecosystem as well, due to continued development of small scale aquaculture in the region. The overriding causative factor for all these effects is the poverty of the lakeshore communities which do not have the economic privilege of being able to adapt their utilisation patterns.

AB The history of the early descriptions of Prosopistoma is reviewed, and the steps taken to trace the original material described as Prosopistoma variegatum Latreille, 1833 are outlined. Eaton (1884) designated P. variegatum as the otypeo of the genus Prosopistoma. Because only the larva was described by Latreille (1833) and this material is no longer available, a larva of this species was selected as the neotype. Scanning electron micrographs of some of the key larval characters provide additional detail for morphological characters not previously described in the Prosopistomatidae. The associated adult male and subimaginal male and female collected from the same sites as verified larvae of P. variegatum are described for the first time.

AB Weight (kg)-age (days) data of 524 Horro sheep of Ethiopia were fitted to a Brody function to estimate parameters of growth curve and their genetic and phenotypic parameters. Genetic and phenotypic relationships were also estimated between growth curve parameters and weight at birth (BW), weaning (WW) six-month (WT6) and yearling (YW). For ewes Pearson correlations were also calculated between growth curve parameters and ewe productivity over first to fourth parities. Least squares means of growth curve parameters A (asymptotic mature weight, kg), B (proportion of mature weight attained after birth) and K (the rate of maturity, kg gain kg(-1) body weight) were 37.6, 0.88, and 0.27.10(-2), respectively. Heritability estimates were 0.29, 0.18 and 0.14 for A, B, and K, respectively. Genetic correlations between A and B, A and K, and B and K were 0.39, -0.07, and 0.25 respectively. Genetic correlations of A and K with BW, WW, WT6, and YW were 0.27 and -0.13, 0.34 and 0.37, 0.44 and 0.61, and 0.67 and 0.66, respectively. The growth curve parameters have small but positive (r=0.05 to 0.28) relationship with indicators of lifetime productivity. Medium heritability estimates of A and K indicate that progress in improving these traits can be made through selection. WT6 and YW have medium genetic correlations with the growth curve parameters and these may allow the use of these weights as indirect early selection criteria for optimum growth curve.

AB Random regression analyses of weight data from birth to 396 days were done using 22 141 weight records of 1 951 Horro lambs. Six different models formed from three different orthogonal polynomial regressions (legendre scale)orders (quadratic, cubic, quartic) of fit for both additive genetic and animals' permanent environmental effects, with assumption of either homogeneous or heterogeneous residual variance, were compared. Fixed effects of year and type of birth, sex and age of dam were fitted along with a fourth order polynomial. Both likelihood ratio test (LRT) and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) were used for model comparison. Model fit improved with increased order of polynomial and assumption of heterogeneity of residual variance. Components for additive genetic and permanent environmental (co)variance increased from 0.03 and 0.09 at birth to 23.8 and 37.6 at 396 days of age, respectively. The first three eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of the additive genetic covariance accounted for about 98% of the sum of all the eigenvalues. Heritability estimates have shown a declining and increasing trend at different parts of the trajectory, the lowest estimate being 0.14 for weight at birth while the highest being 0.36 for weight at about 390 days of age. Higher heritability estimates in previous uni- and bi-variate models and in the current study and also strong correlation with weight at early age makes weight at one year of age the most important trait to consider in improving productivity in Horro sheep.

ID SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS
AB The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method as implemented in the commercial code LS-DYNA has been used to solve the problem of piercing a hole in a stamped shock absorber seat. The results are compared to those produced by dynamic analysis using conventional finite element methods with material erosion as implemented in LS-DYNA. The SPH method is suitable for modelling of cracking and tearing phenomena occurring in actual production of the spring seat for some material and process parameters. The SPH stress levels need to be closely interpreted in contour plots than for the FEA results though as high stresses remain in the disconnected volumes. A rate dependent plasticity model is used in the simulation with data produced by mechanical tests of the materials used.

ID ENDEMIC AREA; TUBERCULOSIS; CHILDREN; SPECIMENS
AB Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) offers a simple outpatient technique for specimen collection in child tuberculosis suspects with peripheral lymphadenopathy. To perform FNAB with mycobacterial culture on an outpatient basis requires use of a sterile transport medium to facilitate bedside inoculation, maintain organism viability and reduce contamination risk en route to the laboratory. The mycobacterial yield and time to positive culture following bedside inoculation into standard mycobacterial growth indicator tubes were compared with initial inoculation into an inexpensive "inhouse'' liquid growth medium. Of 150 FNAB performed, 57 (38%) cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. There was one case each with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Mycobacterium bovis BCG; the remaining 55 being M tuberculosis. Results were concordant in 142 (94.7%) bedside and laboratory inoculation pairs. There was no significant difference in time to positive culture between bedside and laboratory inoculation (16.2 days (SD 0.87) vs 17.1 days (SD 0.85)). Provision of inexpensive specimen transport bottles and practical tuition in FNAB should improve cost-effective diagnosis of tuberculosis at the primary healthcare level.

AB Earthworm densities, mesofaunal and microbiological feeding activity, and soil moisture were measured as indicators of soil health. Fence line contrast sites were used to compare soil organism communities, infiltration rates and soil temperatures of natural vegetation remnants with adjacent transformed lands. Natural remnants retain soil moisture and contain more active soil fauna. Effects of land transformation are demonstrated by a 6.3 degrees C increased soil temperatures. Transformation favoured earthworms with 14 worms per 0.25m3 found in transformed areas compared with an average of four worms found in remnants. Infiltration rates were 4.8 times faster where earthworm casting was present.

In each treatment phase subjects received a single dose (one tablet) of 25 mg exemestane (CAS 107868-30-4). Consecutive dosing was separated by a drug-free washout period of 21 d. Following each dosing, serial venous blood samples were collected over a period of 144 h for the determination of plasma exemestane concentrations by means of a validated LC-MS/MS method. The geometric mean C(max) of exemestane for the reference and test products was 21.48 and 20.14 ng/mL, respectively. The corresponding mean AUC(0-infinity) was 87.12 and 86.90 ng . h/mL. The median T(max) for both products under investigation appeared at 1.70 and 1.97 h, respectively. The test product was well tolerated and shown to be bioequivalent to the reference product with respect to all primary pharmacokinetic variables investigated.

AB Previous reports document transient improvements after daily zolpidem (CAS 82626-48-0) in patients with brain damage. This multi-patient study evaluates the response to zolpidem in neurologically disabled patients, using (99m)TcHMPAO brain SPECT scans and clinical rating scales.
   Method: 23 of 41 consecutive adult patients, at least 6 months after brain damage were identified as neurologically disabled patients by scoring less than 100/100 on the Barthel Index. Causes of their brain damage included stroke (n = 12), traumatic brain injury (n = 7), anaphylaxis (n = 2), drugs overdose (n = 1) and birth injury (n = 1). The selected 23 patients had a baseline (99m)TcHMPAO brain SPECT scan before starting daily zolpidem therapy and a second within two weeks of therapy, performed 1 h after 10 mg oral zolpidem. Scans were designated as improved when at least two of three assessors detected improvement after zolpidem. The rest were designated non improved. After four months daily zolpidem therapy, patients were rated on the Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale (TFES) before and after zolpidem. The TFES ratings were compared using a Wilcoxon non parametric signed rank test. Scan improvers were compared with non improvers, using a two sample t test with unequal variance.
   Results: Mean overall improvement after zolpidem on TFES was 11.3%, from 73.4/100 to 62.1/100 (p = 0.0001). 10/23 (43%) patients improved on SPECT scan after zolpidem. Their mean TFES improvement was 19.4% (+/- 16.75) compared with 5.08% (+/- 5.17) in 13/23 non improvers (p = 0.0081).
   Conclusion: This prospective study adds further evidence to previous reports of zolpidem efficacy in patients with established brain damage.

AB In continuation of studies focusing on the transdermal delivery of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, the skin permeation ability of synthesized homologous series of both oligomeric and polymeric ethylene glycol (PEG) carbonates of zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT, CAS 30516-87-1) and stavudine (2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymine, d4T, CAS 3056-17-5) was evaluated in vitro through excised human skin in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) (0.01 M, pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C by using Franz cell diffusion methodology. The results revealed that all the derivatives permeated the skin regardless of the series. However, the derivative having three ethylene glycol repeating units was the most effective permeant in each series. The skin permeation rates of zidovudine and stavudine were enhanced by factors in the 2-4, and 1-3 range through these carbonates, respectively.

AB Series of 4-aminoquinolines bearing an amino side chain linked to the ferrocene moiety through an amide bond were synthesized and evaluated for their antimalarial activity against both chloroquine-sensitive (D10, CQ-S) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2, CQ-R) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. They were also tested for cytotoxicity against Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells. Amide 12 featuring propyl side chain linked to the ferrocene ring was the most active of all tested compounds. With an 1050 value of 0.08 mu g/mL, this amide showed 1.5-fold higher activity than chloroquine diphosphate (IC(50) = 0.12 mu g/mL) against the resistant strain, with a selectivity index of 550 indicating its high selectivity towards the parasite. Derivatives which were equipotent against both strains also showed up to ten-fold increase in activity compared to primaquine.

AB The purpose of this study was to synthesize a series of delta-amide derivatives of the antitrypanosomal drug eflornithine (2,5-diamino-2-(difluoromethyl)pentanoic acid hydrochloride, DMFO, CAS 70052-12-9), to determine their physicochemical properties and to assess whether they convert to eflornithine in vivo and if so, whether higher systemic exposure to eflornithine could be achieved by increase intestinal absorption, suggesting an oral treatment to be possible. The derivatives were synthesized by amidation of eflornithine on its delta-amino group using acyl chlorides. The partition coefficients (log D, pH = 7.4) were found to be between -0.78 +/- 1.07 and -0.07 +/- 1.08 while the aqueous solubility (S(w)), which as determined in phosphate buffered solution (pH 7.4), ranged from 11.13 +/- 0.32 to 28.74 +/- 0.36 mg/mL. The synthesized compounds were thus mostly more lipophilic than eflornithine itself (log D = -0.98 +/- 0.88, S(w) = 34.96 +/- 0.37 mg/mL). The intestinal absorption was assessed by plasma analysis after oral administration of each compound to Sprague-Dawley rats. The biological data revealed that the derivatives were either not absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract or not metabolized into eflornithine as no parent drug was detected in the plasma.

AB The present Study highlights the application of perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB), an oxygen carrier, in a fixed-film membrane gradostat reactors (MGRs) in which biofilms of Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKMF-1767 (ATCC 24725) were immobilised. The nutrient medium used in the MGRs was supplemented with PFOB and Pluronic F 68 (PF 68) to alleviate limitations associated with the performance of the immobilised fungus. Lower lignin peroxidase production in PFOB/PF 68 Cultures was observed compared to manganese peroxidase production, suggesting an insignificant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lipid peroxidation, quantified by the formation of malondialdehyde, was lower in the immobilised cultures. After successfully applying PFOB and PF 68 to immobilised P. chrysosporium biofilms in the MGRs, the following results were obtained:([1]) reduced ethanol production,([2]) reduced trace element accumulation,([3]) lower P-glucan production and([4]) in improved dissolved oxygen penetration ratio in the immobilised biofilms.

AB The very low cut-off value for sperm morphology of 4% morphologically normal spermatozoa, as proposed in the new edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) manual on semen analysis, is in agreement with recently published values and reflects the trend of a decline in reported mean values for normal sperm morphology. The reduced value for morphologically normal spermatozoa over the years may be due to several factors. The first is the introduction of strict criteria for the evaluation of sperm morphology. Other reasons may include the introduction of additional criteria for sperm morphology abnormalities and the suggested decrease in semen parameters because of increasing negative environmental influences. Although on its own the newly proposed very low normal value may not provide the strong predictive value for a males' fertility potential, as originally reported for sperm morphology evaluated according to strict criteria, a good predictive value can still be obtained if the holistic, strict approach for sperm morphology evaluation is followed together with additional sperm morphology parameters now available, because certain morphology patterns and sperm abnormalities are now known to be of strong prognostic value. In addition, better international standardization of the technical methodology, consensus on the interpretation of sperm morphology evaluation criteria and standardized international external quality control (EQC) schemes, are of utmost importance to maintain the good predictive value of sperm morphology.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this descriptive cross-sectional study were to assess the awareness about cervical cancer and preventive behaviour of female first year Mangosuthu University of Technology students. Methods: A total of 205 students were selected by stratified random sampling techniques. Results: 40% of the students were currently sexually active and among them 28% reported having two or more sexual partners. A third (33%) of the participants heard about cervical cancer. Among them a third (32%) and over a quarter (26%) knew about the HPV virus and multiple sexual partners, respectively, as risk factors for cervical cancer. Participants were twice more likely to use condoms if they heard about cervical cancer (OR = 2.47, p = 0.003). Only 31% participants had heard about the Pap smear test, and among them a third (33%) knew that Pap smear is used for detection or prevention of cervical cancer. Conclusion: University management should concentrate on developing policies on health education and promotion particularly targeting preventable health conditions to prevent transmission of the HPV virus.

TI Perceived Benefits of Cervical Cancer Screening among Women Attending

SO ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Perceived benefits; cervical cancer; screening; Mahalapye district
   hospital; Botswana
AB Objectives: The objectives of the study were to describe women's perceived benefits regarding cervical cancer and their association with socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted by questionnaire survey. A total of 300 participants were selected by convenience sampling techniques. Results: Participants' mean age was 37 years (SD=11) and their cervical cancer screening rate was 39%. The majority (87%) either agreed or strongly agreed that 'screening is important to be done', while 75% believed screening could find changes in the cervix before full cancer arises and 84% that when found early cervical cancer can be easily cured. Comparing between ever screened and never screened, both groups agreed or strongly agreed that screening is important (88.8% versus 87.3%), and can find changes before they become cancer (83% versus 69.8%) and that cervical cancer is easily curable when detected early (92.4% versus 79.5%). Some 42.4% ever screened and 36.1% never screened responded not sure to whether cervical cancer decreases chances of an abortion. We did not find any socio-demographic variables which were significantly associated with perceived benefits of cervical cancer screening. Perceived benefits was not a significant predictor for cervical cancer screening (OR=1.291, p=0.33). Conclusion: The screening rate is still far too low compared to the National target of greater than 75%. Therefore, despite awareness of the perceived benefits of cervical cancer, the reasons why at risk women fail to participate in cervical cancer screening needs to be adequately explored.

AB The earliest archaeological sites in East Asia suggest that making and using stone artifacts was a consistent part of the subsistence strategy of these earliest immigrants to East Asia. Although there are many differences between the earliest archaeological record in Africa and Asia, a few aspects of these industries allow formal comparisons. Here we review aspects of the African Oldowan archaeological record and compare it to the large and well-studied archaeological record from the Nihewan Basin. We suggest that the technological strategies shown in these East Asian Early Paleolithic assemblages are consistent with a subsistence pattern where stone tool mediated resources played a very different role than that found in East Africa. We suggest that the poor quality of available materials were not conducive to the maintenance of complex toolkits. Early Pleistocene hominins in East Asia may have exploited a series of diverse resources that had distinct technological requirements. In this sense the ecology of these hominins may have been very different from their African counterparts.

TI Competitive intelligence skills needed to enhance South Africa's
   competitiveness
SO ASLIB PROCEEDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE Competitive strategy; Skills; Human resource development; South Africa
AB Purpose - South Africa as a country continues to rank low in the world of competitiveness. It is the aim of this paper to focus on the need for South African organisations to perceive competitive intelligence (Cl) as one of the most important tools to improve their competitiveness through a systematic, practical approach to make the CI cycle worthwhile, especially through skills development. The paper intends to identify the skills CI professionals in South Africa need in order to conduct the CI process in organisations effectively, thereby improving the country's competitive position.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research for the paper is based on an extensive review of literature to identify the skills needed by CI professionals. A survey was conducted, by questionnaire, among organisations in South Africa with existing CI units in which the respondents had to identify the skills they deemed necessary for the CI professional to run the CI process effectively.
   Findings - Findings suggested that the majority of respondents were 40 years and older, in the top structure of larger organisations and had been using CI for longer than five years. The overwhelming result is that there are skills inequalities between what skills respondents view as crucial and those that rated highest in their self-evaluation. Skills identified as most important include, among others, networking, research skills and analytical abilities.
   Research limitations/implications - CI in South Africa is still in its infancy and in 2008 no professional CI groups existed. As a result, there is no recognised list of practising South African CI professionals available in South Africa. For this reason the respondent database consists of attendees of CI courses, workshops and seminars held by the Department of Information and Knowledge Management at the University of Johannesburg.
   Practical implications - The research indicated that where CI had been established in certain organisations for at least five years, it did not reflect positively overall on South Africa's current competitive situation. Where there is a systematic CI approach, however, problem-solving is easier to address and negatives could be turned around. With this in mind and a proper "buy-in" into skills development, it will have a very positive outcome for all the organisations that wish to improve their competitiveness.
   Originality/value - For a country such as South Africa (and other developing countries) this research is of extreme importance as the country is facing a serious shortage of skills. Skills development of CI professionals can create a strategic advantage for the country and increase South Africa's competitiveness.

TI An automated apparatus for dynamic inspection of mass-produced custom
   parts
SO ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Mass customization; Inspection; Quality control; Manufacturing systems
AB Purpose - Quality control and part inspection add no monetary value to a product, yet are essential processes for manufacturers who want to maintain product quality. Mass-produced custom parts require processes that are able to perform high frequency of inspection, whilst providing rapid response to unanticipated changes in parameters such as throughputs, dimensions and tolerances. Frequent inspection of these parts significantly impacts inspection times involved. A method of reducing the impact of high-frequency inspection on production rates is needed. This paper addresses these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper involves the research, design, construction, assembly and implementation of an automated apparatus, used for the visual inspection of moving custom parts. Inspection occurred at user-defined regions of interest (ROIs). Mechatronic Engineering principles are used to integrate sensor articulation, image acquisition and image-processing systems. The apparatus is tested in a computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) cell for quantifying results.
   Findings - Specified production rates are maintained whilst performing high frequencies of inspection, without stoppage of parts along the production line.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations of these results lie in the fact that they are suited only to the speed of the CIM cell. Higher inspection rates may be achieved, and changes in the design may be required in order to make the apparatus more suitable to industrial applications.
   Practical implications - The paper shows that it is possible to maintain high standards of quality control without significantly affecting production rates.
   Originality/value - Current research does not focus on maintaining production rates whilst inspecting custom parts. The use of ROI inspection for moving custom parts is a relatively new concept.

AB The CLEAN algorithm, despite its problematic convergence properties and its need for heuristic intervention and tuning, is the most commonly used means of attenuating sampling artifacts in images made through radio interferometry. Subsequent modifications adapted CLEAN to observations made using a wide fractional bandwidth, which are not well handled by the original algorithm. Here a generalized version of the wide-band algorithm is applied to time-variable sources.

AB Aims. We report first results from our extensive survey of the very small (H > 21.5 mag) near-Earth asteroids. Our aim was to obtain photometric lightcurves for these faint, fast moving objects and to measure their rotation periods and amplitudes of light variations. These parameters can be used to make statistical analysis of the still little known population of the smallest asteroids, test present theories of the YORP effect as well as to study their spin limits, which are connected with their internal structure.
   Methods. Due to the faintness of the targets and the expected short periods of rotation, observations were performed with the large, 10(-)m SALT telescope in SAAO (South Africa). For most asteroids, V filter images with exposure times of 5-60 s were obtained with the instrument's SALTICAM's CCD camera. Even though the non-sidereal tracking was not available, the SALTICAM's relatively large field-of-view of 8' x 8' helped to perform the relative photometry of the fast-moving targets.
   Results. The presented asteroids have synodic periods ranging from 77 s to 44 min, effective diameters from 21 to 94 m, and significantly elongated shapes.

DT Article
DE hydrodynamics; instabilities; planets and satellites: atmospheres; waves
AB This letter reports on the important features of an analysis of the combined theory of gravity - inertial - Rossby waves on a beta-plane in the Boussinesq approximation. In particular, it is shown that the coupling between higher frequency gravity - inertial waves and lower frequency Rossby waves, arising from the accumulated influences of the beta effect, stratification characterized by the Vaisala - Brunt frequency N, the Coriolis frequency f, and the component of vertical propagation wave number k(z), may lead to an unstable coupling between buoyancy - inertial modes with westward propagating Rossby waves. "Supersonic" fast rotators (such as Jupiter) are predicted to be unstable in a fairly narrow band of latitudes around their equators. The Earth is moderately supersonic and exhibits instability within about 34 degrees of its equator. Slow "subsonic" rotators (e. g. Mercury, Venus, and the Sun's corona) are unstable at all latitudes except those very close to the poles where the beta effect vanishes.

AB Based on the Millennium Simulation we examine assembly bias for the halo properties: shape, triaxiality, concentration, spin, shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and velocity anisotropy. For consistency, we determine all these properties using the same set of particles, namely all gravitationally self-bound particles belonging to the most massive substructure of a given friends-of-friends halo. We confirm that near-spherical and high-spin halos show enhanced clustering. The opposite is true for strongly aspherical and low-spin halos. Further, below the typical collapse mass, M(*), more concentrated halos show stronger clustering, whereas less concentrated halos are less clustered which is reversed for masses above M*. Going beyond earlier work we show that: (1) oblate halos are more strongly clustered than prolate ones; (2) the dependence of clustering on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid coincides with that of the real-space shape, although the signal is stronger; (3) halos with weak velocity anisotropy are more clustered, whereas radially anisotropic halos are more weakly clustered; (4) for all highly clustered subsets we find systematically less radially biased velocity anisotropy profiles. These findings indicate that the velocity structure of halos is tightly correlated with environment.

TI TYPE II-P SUPERNOVAE FROM THE SDSS-II SUPERNOVA SURVEY AND THE
   STANDARDIZED CANDLE METHOD

AB We apply the Standardized Candle Method (SCM) for Type II Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a SN to its luminosity during the plateau, to 15 SNe II-P discovered over the three season run of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey. The redshifts of these SNe-0.027 < z < 0.144-cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature; in particular, our SNe II-P sample contains nearly as many SNe in the Hubble flow (z > 0.01) as all of the current literature on the SCM combined. We find that the SDSS SNe have a very small intrinsic I-band dispersion (0.22 mag), which can be attributed to selection effects. When the SCM is applied to the combined SDSS-plus-literature set of SNe II-P, the dispersion increases to 0.29 mag, larger than the scatter for either set of SNe separately. We show that the standardization cannot be further improved by eliminating SNe with positive plateau decline rates, as proposed in Poznanski et al. We thoroughly examine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the SCM to be useful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the Fe II velocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompass the intrinsic variations of Type II-P SNe will be needed.

AB We make an inventory of the baryonic and gravitating mass in structures ranging from the smallest galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. We find that the fraction of baryons converted to stars reaches a maximum between M(500) = 10(12) and 10(13) M(circle dot), suggesting that star formation is most efficient in bright galaxies in groups. The fraction of baryons detected in all forms deviates monotonically from the cosmic baryon fraction as a function of mass. On the largest scales of clusters, most of the expected baryons are detected, while in the smallest dwarf galaxies, fewer than 1% are detected. Where these missing baryons reside is unclear.

AB The ca. 1315 Ma Hosenbein massif-type anorthosite pluton (Nain, Labrador) shows complete exposure of a vertical section, described here for the first time, comprising a similar to 2000 m-thick Main Zone bound by a similar to 200 m-thick Marginal Zone. The pluton as a whole consists mostly of monocumulate leucogabbronorite, leuconorite, and anorthosite (similar to 94 vol% of all rocks) with elevated abundances of gabbronorite-ferrodiorite (similar to 27 vol%) in the Marginal Zone. Parental magma likely comprised a plagioclase-phyric basaltic melt, containing similar to 15-45 vol% plagioclase phenocrysts. Crystallization of this magma produced predominantly massive adcumulate-mesocumulate with less abundant, but regular, occurrences of (in order of relative abundance) gabbronorite-ferrodiorite segregations, mottled texture, foliation, pyroxenite aggregates, and modal layering. Additional key petrographic and compositional features include high-T deformation microstructures in plagioclase, vertically consistent mineral compositions, and enrichment of Fe-Ti- P-HFSE-REE in ferrodiorite. Parts of the Marginal Zone show gneissic-mylonitic fabrics that developed parallel to magma conduits. Collectively these features suggest that the textural and structural evolution of the pluton was controlled by: (a) emplacement of plagioclase-phyric magma, (b) establishment of vast cumulus crystal frameworks, (c) porous flow of intercumulus melt, (d) compaction, and (e) synplutonic deformation. These interpretations contrast with previous work emphasizing the importance of magmatic flow and crystal settling/flotation.

AB Gaseous mercury in the marine boundary layer has been measured with a 15 min temporal resolution at the Global Atmosphere Watch station Cape Point since March 2007. The most prominent features of the data until July 2008 are the frequent occurrences of pollution (PEs) and depletion events (DEs). Both types of events originate mostly within a short transport distance (up to about 100 km), which are embedded in air masses ranging from marine background to continental. The Hg/CO emission ratios observed during the PEs are within the range reported for biomass burning and industrial/urban emissions. The depletion of gaseous mercury during the DEs is in many cases almost complete and suggests an atmospheric residence time of elemental mercury as short as a few dozens of hours, which is in contrast to the commonly used estimate of approximately 1 year. The DEs observed at Cape Point are not accompanied by simultaneous depletion of ozone which distinguishes them from the halogen driven atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) observed in Polar Regions. Nonetheless, DEs similar to those observed at Cape Point have also been observed at other places in the marine boundary layer. Additional measurements of mercury speciation and of possible mercury oxidants are hence called for to reveal the chemical mechanism of the newly observed DEs and to assess its importance on larger scales.

AB The occurrence of a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) excites disturbances in the mesosphere-lower thermospheric (MLT) wind and temperature. Here, we have examined the high frequency (HF) radar wind data from the South African National Antarctic Expedition, SANAE (72 degrees S, 3 degrees W), a radar which is part of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on board the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite temperature data and National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) temperature and wind data are used to investigate the dynamical effects of the unprecedented September 2002 SSW in the Antarctica stratosphere and MLT. The mean zonal wind (from SANAE HF radar) at the MLT shows reversal approximately 7 days before the reversal at 10 hPa (from NCEP). This indicates that there was a downwards propagation of circulation disturbance. Westerly zonal winds dominate the winter MLT, but during the 2002 winter there are many periods of westward winds observed compared to other years. The normalised power spectrums of both meridional and zonal winds show presence of planetary waves (of similar to 14-day period) before the occurrence of the SSW. The SABER vertical temperature profiles indicated the cooling of the MLT region before the SSW event.

AB We present the longest series of measurements so far (2 years and 7 months) made with an Ion-DMPS at the SMEAR II measurement station in Hyytiala, Southern Finland. We show that the classification into overcharged (implying some participation of ion-induced nucleation) and undercharged (implying no or very little participation of ion-induced nucleation) days, based on Ion-DMPS measurements, agrees with the fraction of ion-induced nucleation based on NAIS measurements. Those classes are based on the ratio of ambient charged particle to steady-state charged particle concentration, known as the charging state. We analyzed the influence of different parameters on the contribution of ion-induced nucleation to the total particle formation rate. We found that the fraction of ion-induced nucleation is typically higher on warmer, drier and sunnier days compared to colder days with less solar radiation and a higher relative humidity. Also, we observed that bigger concentrations of new particles were produced on days with a smaller fraction of ion-induced nucleation. Moreover, sulfuric acid saturation ratios were smaller for days with a bigger fraction of ion-induced nucleation. Finally, we propose explanations on how these different parameters could influence neutral and ion-induced nucleation, and show that the different mechanisms seem to take place at the same time during an event. For example, we propose that these observed differences could be due to high temperature and low vapors' saturation ratios (water and sulfuric acid) increasing the height of the energy barrier a particle has to reach before it can grow and thus limiting neutral nucleation.

AB This paper provides an up-to-date assessment of global mercury emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources. On an annual basis, natural sources account for 5207 Mg of mercury released to the global atmosphere, including the contribution from re-emission processes, which are emissions of previously deposited mercury originating from anthropogenic and natural sources, and primary emissions from natural reservoirs. Anthropogenic sources, which include a large number of industrial point sources, are estimated to account for 2320 Mg of mercury emitted annually. The major contributions are from fossil-fuel fired power plants (810 Mg yr(-1)), artisanal small scale gold mining (400 Mg yr(-1)), non-ferrous metals manufacturing (310 Mg yr(-1)), cement production (236 Mg yr(-1)), waste disposal (187 Mg yr(-1)) and caustic soda production (163 Mg yr(-1)). Therefore, our current estimate of global mercury emissions suggests that the overall contribution from natural sources (primary emissions + re-emissions) and anthropogenic sources is nearly 7527 Mg per year, the uncertainty associated with these estimates are related to the typology of emission sources and source regions.

AB In this paper we present the long term monitoring of ambient gaseous concentrations within the framework of the IDAF (IGAC-DEBITS-AFRICA) program. This study proposes for the first time an analysis of long-term inorganic gas concentrations (1998 to 2007) of SO(2), NO(2), HNO(3), NH(3) and O(3), determined using passive samplers at seven remote sites in West and Central Africa. Sites are representative of several African ecosystems and are located along a transect from dry savannas-wet savannas-forests with sites at Banizoumbou (Niger), Katibougou and Agoufou (Mali), Djougou (Benin), Lamto (Cote d'Ivoire), Zoetele (Cameroon) and Bomassa (Congo). The strict control of measurement techniques as well as the validation and inter-comparison studies conducted with the IDAF passive samplers assure the quality and accuracy of the measurements. For each type of African ecosystem, the long term data series have been studied to document the levels of surface gaseous concentrations. The seasonal and interannual variability have also been analyzed as a function of emission source variations. We compared the measured West and Central African gas concentrations to results obtained in other parts of the world. Results show that the annual mean concentrations of NO(2), NH(3), HNO(3) measured in dry savannas are higher than those measured in wet savannas and forests that have quite similar concentrations. Annual mean NO(2) concentrations vary from 0.9+/-0.2 in forests to 2.4+/-0.4 ppb in the dry savannas, NH(3) from 3.9+/-1.4 to 7.4+/-0.8 ppb and HNO(3) from 0.2+/-0.1 to 0.5+/-0.2 ppb. Annual mean O(3) and SO(2) concentrations are lower for all ecosystems and range from 4.0+/-0.4 to 14.0+/-2.8 and from 0.3+/-0.1 to 1.0+/-0.2 ppb, respectively. A focus on the processes involved in gas emissions from dry savannas is presented in this work, providing explanations for the high concentrations of all gases measured at the three dry savannas sites. At these sites, seasonal concentrations of all gases are higher in the wet season. Conversely, concentrations are higher in the dry season in the wet savannas. In forested regions, we measure no significant difference between wet and dry seasons. This unique database of long term gases concentrations monitoring is available at: http://medias.obs-mip.fr/idaf/.

AB This paper mainly focuses on the trends and variability of the UT-LS temperature using radiosonde observations carried out over 16 years (January 1993 to December 2008) from a southern subtropical site, Reunion (20.8A degrees S, 55.5A degrees E), using a linear-regression fitting model. Two kinds of tropopause definitions, namely, cold point tropopause (CPT) and lapse rate tropopause (LRT) are used. In order to characterize and quantify the relationship between regional oceanic forcing and temperature at UT-LS, we took into account the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) for the estimation of temperature trends. Results show that the main component is the Annual Cycle (AC), particularly at tropopause (CPT, LRT) and in the lower stratosphere (LS) where more than 26.0 +/- 2.4% of temperature variability can be explained by AC. The influence of IOD on the variability of the temperature is at highest ratio at CPT and LS, with respectively 12.3 +/- 7.3% and 13.1 +/- 5.9%. The correlations between IOD and temperature anomalies at UT-LS are barely significant, which are found to be in close agreement with the results obtained by Rosenlof et al. (2008) over the western tropical Pacific Ocean. The temperature trend in the LS reveals a cooling of about -0.90 +/- 0.40 K per decade. The cooling trend at LS is found to be in close agreement with the others studies. Trend estimates in the LS suggest that IOD forcing contributes to increasing cooling by about 0.16 +/- 0.05 K per decade. Past works have shown that the additional carbon dioxide increase has a minor effect in the LS, and suggested that other effects than ozone and carbon dioxide changes have to be considered, in order to explain the observed temperature changes in the LS. From this study, we can suggest that the SST changes can be considered also, in addition to effects due to ozone and carbon dioxide changes, in order to explain the observed temperature changes in the LS. As a consequence, our results support the assumption that the Indian Ocean may have a slight impact on temperature variability and on temperature change in the LS over Reunion.

AB Projections of stratospheric ozone from a suite of chemistry-climate models (CCMs) have been analyzed. In addition to a reference simulation where anthropogenic halogenated ozone depleting substances (ODSs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) vary with time, sensitivity simulations with either ODS or GHG concentrations fixed at 1960 levels were performed to disaggregate the drivers of projected ozone changes. These simulations were also used to assess the two distinct milestones of ozone returning to historical values (ozone return dates) and ozone no longer being influenced by ODSs (full ozone recovery). The date of ozone returning to historical values does not indicate complete recovery from ODSs in most cases, because GHG-induced changes accelerate or decelerate ozone changes in many regions. In the upper stratosphere where CO2-induced stratospheric cooling increases ozone, full ozone recovery is projected to not likely have occurred by 2100 even though ozone returns to its 1980 or even 1960 levels well before (similar to 2025 and 2040, respectively). In contrast, in the tropical lower stratosphere ozone decreases continuously from 1960 to 2100 due to projected increases in tropical upwelling, while by around 2040 it is already very likely that full recovery from the effects of ODSs has occurred, although ODS concentrations are still elevated by this date. In the midlatitude lower stratosphere the evolution differs from that in the tropics, and rather than a steady decrease in ozone, first a decrease in ozone is simulated from 1960 to 2000, which is then followed by a steady increase through the 21st century. Ozone in the midlatitude lower stratosphere returns to 1980 levels by similar to 2045 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and by similar to 2055 in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and full ozone recovery is likely reached by 2100 in both hemispheres. Overall, in all regions except the tropical lower stratosphere, full ozone recovery from ODSs occurs significantly later than the return of total column ozone to its 1980 level. The latest return of total column ozone is projected to occur over Antarctica (similar to 2045-2060) whereas it is not likely that full ozone recovery is reached by the end of the 21st century in this region. Arctic total column ozone is projected to return to 1980 levels well before polar stratospheric halogen loading does so (similar to 2025-2030 for total column ozone, cf. 2050-2070 for Cl-y+60xBr(y)) and it is likely that full recovery of total column ozone from the effects of ODSs has occurred by similar to 2035. In contrast to the Antarctic, by 2100 Arctic total column ozone is projected to be above 1960 levels, but not in the fixed GHG simulation, indicating that climate change plays a significant role.

AB Future stratospheric ozone concentrations will be determined both by changes in the concentration of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) and by changes in stratospheric and tropospheric climate, including those caused by changes in anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs). Since future economic development pathways and resultant emissions of GHGs are uncertain, anthropogenic climate change could be a significant source of uncertainty for future projections of stratospheric ozone. In this pilot study, using an "ensemble of opportunity" of chemistry-climate model (CCM) simulations, the contribution of scenario uncertainty from different plausible emissions pathways for ODSs and GHGs to future ozone projections is quantified relative to the contribution from model uncertainty and internal variability of the chemistry-climate system. For both the global, annual mean ozone concentration and for ozone in specific geographical regions, differences between CCMs are the dominant source of uncertainty for the first two-thirds of the 21st century, upto and after the time when ozone concentrations return to 1980 values. In the last third of the 21st century, dependent upon the set of greenhouse gas scenarios used, scenario uncertainty can be the dominant contributor. This result suggests that investment in chemistry-climate modelling is likely to continue to refine projections of stratospheric ozone and estimates of the return of stratospheric ozone concentrations to pre-1980 levels.

AB Within the project EUCAARI (European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality interactions), atmospheric nucleation was studied by (i) developing and testing new air ion and cluster spectrometers, (ii) conducting homogeneous nucleation experiments for sulphate and organic systems in the laboratory, (iii) investigating atmospheric nucleation mechanism under field conditions, and (iv) applying new theoretical and modelling tools for data interpretation and development of parameterisations. The current paper provides a synthesis of the obtained results and identifies the remaining major knowledge gaps related to atmospheric nucleation. The most important technical achievement of the project was the development of new instruments for measuring sub-3 nm particle populations, along with the extensive application of these instruments in both the laboratory and the field. All the results obtained during EUCAARI indicate that sulphuric acid plays a central role in atmospheric nucleation. However, also vapours other than sulphuric acid are needed to explain the nucleation and the subsequent growth processes, at least in continental boundary layers. Candidate vapours in this respect are some organic compounds, ammonia, and especially amines. Both our field and laboratory data demonstrate that the nucleation rate scales to the first or second power of the nucleating vapour concentration(s). This agrees with the few earlier field observations, but is in stark contrast with classical thermodynamic nucleation theories. The average formation rates of 2-nm particles were found to vary by almost two orders of magnitude between the different EUCAARI sites, whereas the formation rates of charged 2-nm particles varied very little between the sites. Overall, our observations are indicative of frequent, yet moderate, ion-induced nucleation usually outweighed by much stronger neutral nucleation events in the continental lower troposphere. The most concrete outcome of the EUCAARI nucleation studies are the new semi-empirical nucleation rate parameterizations based on field observations, along with updated aerosol formation parameterizations.

TI Calibration of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network using aircraft

AB The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) produces precise measurements of the column average dry-air mole fractions of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O and H2O at a variety of sites worldwide. These observations rely on spectroscopic parameters that are not known with sufficient accuracy to compute total columns that can be used in combination with in situ measurements. The TCCON must therefore be calibrated to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in situ trace gas measurement scales. We present a calibration of TCCON data using WMO-scale instrumentation aboard aircraft that measured profiles over four TCCON stations during 2008 and 2009. These calibrations are compared with similar observations made in 2004 and 2006. The results indicate that a single, global calibration factor for each gas accurately captures the TCCON total column data within error.

AB Sugar-type preferences of nectarivores may be an important selective factor in the evolution Of Sugar composition in floral nectar. We investigated sugar preferences of the Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa), using experiments in which birds were offered paired choices between energetically equivalent solutions over a range of sugar concentrations. The birds preferred hexose at low (5%) concentration and sucrose at high (25%) concentration; they showed no preference at 10%, 15%, and 20% concentrations. The birds regulated energy intake by adjusting volumetric Consumption, except on a 5% concentration diet, where they failed to maintain energy balance. They also exhibited a strong preference for concentrated solutions, given a choice between 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% sucrose solutions. We discuss the significance of these results in terms of the nectar composition Of sunbird-pollinated plants. Received 5 August 2008, accepted 29 July 2009.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an educational computer video game in teaching and learning. Cultural-historical activity theory is used heuristically to explore the social and cultural interactions during game play. It is argued that knowledge construction occurs when video games function as a tool to mediate learning rather than as instructional media. The unit of analysis is not the game as instruction but engagement with the game. Twelve 14 to 19 year old black orphans from Soweto, South Africa, participated in a case study. Groups of three participants, which included both sexes, played the game for at least six hours, kept a personal reflective journal, and after play answered a knowledge test and participated in a round-robin discussion. Results show that participants gained new knowledge, recognised that the game mediated their learning, identified the object of the activity and discussed how they might help their community. Results support the use of games as tools to mediate learning.

AB Fruit pathogens are currently one of the main factors involved in quarantine-related market access. Unconfirmed South African records pertaining to the presence of the causative agent of European canker of apples, Neonectria ditissima, have been the cause of many disputes regarding its status as a quarantine pest in this country. To clarify this issue, the identity of fungal isolates that were presumed to be N. ditissima, were verified by making use of species-specific PCR primers designed for N. ditissima. The isolates were obtained from symptomatic apple trees in the major apple-producing areas in South Africa. These data were supplemented by a morphological reexamination of all six previous herbarium specimens presumed to be N. ditissima. The results revealed that none of the samples tested positive for N. ditissima, nor were any of the six herbarium specimens representative of Neonectria species. This study represents the first attempt to resolve the status of N. ditissima in South Africa by means of a molecular approach, and our findings support the current regulated status of N. ditissima in South Africa.

AB The recently described Cryphonectriaceae (Diaporthales) includes numerous important tree pathogens such as the chestnut blight pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica, and various species of Chrysoporthe that cause serious stem canker diseases on Eucalyptus. A recent investigation of dying Eucalyptus grandis clonal hedges in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, revealed the presence of an unknown member of the Cryphonectriaceae. DNA sequence comparisons with other members of the Cryphonectriaceae showed that the Indonesian fungus represents a new genus and species in the family, for which we provide the name Cryptometrion austuescens gen. sp. nov. It can be distinguished from other Cryphonectriaceae on Eucalyptus, such as Chrysoporthe, Microthia, Holocryphia and Cryphonectria, based on its orange, limited stromatic tissue, single septate, fusoid to ellipsoid ascospores and the absence of paraphyses among the conidiogenous cells in the anamorph. Inoculations with this fungus on two clones of E. grandis showed that it is highly pathogenic and has the capacity to cause serious losses to Eucalyptus plantations in the region.

TI The Eucalyptus canker pathogen Chrysoporthe cubensis discovered in
   eastern Australia
SO AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY

DT Article
ID CRYPHONECTRIA-CUBENSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TIBOUCHINA; PLANTATION; COLOMBIA;
   NITENS
AB Chrysoporthe cubensis is an important pathogen of commercially planted Eucalyptus species (Myrtaceae) in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where these trees are planted as non-natives. Although the majority of Eucalyptus spp. are native to Australia, Chr. cubensis is not common there and has been reported only once from naturally growing Eucalyptus marginata in Western Australia. Chr. cubensis is able to infect hosts in the Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae other than Eucalyptus, but has not been found on hosts other than Eucalyptus in Australia. Recently, fruiting structures resembling those of Chr. cubensis were discovered on Tibouchina heteromalla, planted as a non-native in the Botanical Gardens in Cairns, northern Queensland. These fruiting structures and resulting isolates were characterised as Chr. cubensis in this study. Pathogenicity studies found that Corymbia spp., including commercially important spotted gum, are susceptible along with E. pilularis and E. dunnii. The discovery of Chr. cubensis on a non-native plant in the northern part of Australia is important as it might imply that the pathogen has been introduced into the country and pose a significant threat to native Eucalyptus forests. Alternatively, this fungus might occur naturally in the area on hosts other than Tibouchina, possibly Eucalyptus or related species, and that Australia forms part of its native range.

AB Coniothyrium canker caused by the fungal pathogen Teratosphaeria (= Coniothyrium) zuluensis is one of the most important diseases affecting plantation-grown Eucalyptus trees. Little is known regarding the pathogen and this study consequently considers the genetic diversity and population structure of T. zuluensis. Eleven microsatellites markers, of which six were developed in this study, were used to analyse two temporally separated populations of T. zuluensis from South Africa, one population from Malawi and one population from China. Results showed that the populations of T. zuluensis have a moderate to high diversity and that clonal reproduction is predominant. There was also evidence that the genetic diversity of the pathogen in South Africa has increased over time. Comparison of T. zuluensis populations from South Africa, Malawi and China suggest that South Africa is most probably not the centre of origin of the pathogen as has previously been suggested.

AB The oomycete Phytophthora capsici is an economically important plant pathogen worldwide. Not much is known about this pathogen in South Africa. Therefore, the first aim of the study was to obtain a better understanding of the host range and distribution of the pathogen. Second, South African P. capsici isolates were characterised through mating-type tests and genotyping with eight microsatellite markers (simple sequence repeat markers (SSR)) that were developed from the draft genome sequence. Analyses of diseased samples from 2000 to 2008 showed that P. capsici was present in at least five provinces on cucurbitaceous (Cucumis melo and Cucurbita spp.) and solanaceous (Capsicum spp. and Lycopersicon esculentum) crops. Mating-type analyses of 78 isolates collected from these hosts showed that both mating types were present in all the sampled production regions. The mating-type frequency in the total South African population did not deviate significantly from a 1 : 1 ratio. Microsatellite genotyping of the isolates revealed that genotypic diversity was high in all regional populations with 59 of 78 isolates representing unique SSR multilocus genotypes (MLG). The remaining 19 isolates consisted of eight MLG that each included two to three isolates with identical SSR alleles. These identical isolates were considered to be clones that were derived from asexual reproduction due to significant P(SEX) < 0.003 and P(SEX)(f) < 0.008 probability values. Clonal genotypes were identified within and between production regions (Limpopo and Mpumalanga), on different crops (bell pepper, piquante pepper and tomato) and across years.

TI Detection of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae causing bacterial blight
   on pomegranate in South Africa
SO AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEQUENCES
AB In 2007, an outbreak of disease occurred in South African pomegranate orchards. The symptoms included leaf and fruit spots, and cankers on stems, branches and trunks. Based on biochemical and molecular analyses and pathogenicity tests, the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae was identified as the causal agent. This is the first report of bacterial blight on pomegranate in South Africa.

TI Savanna woody plant dynamics: the role of fire and herbivory, separately
   and synergistically
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY

AB Although the demography of woody plants in savannas has long been shown to be due to many factors, there still is no consensus as to the relative importance of the top-down processes of fire and herbivory, nor on how fire and herbivory affect plant demography. We review the recent literature and suggest that further progress depends on the following: (i) a demographic framework with clear terminology and which focuses on recruitment, transitions and mortality, (ii) an understanding of mechanisms of how fire actually damages plants and how plants survive and out-grow this damage, mainly through height, bark thickness or diameter growth, (iii) an understanding of how losses in biomass due to herbivory may affect plant demography and, (iv) a consideration of interactions between fire and herbivory. Our synthesis suggests (i) strong recruitment limitation as well as some evidence of transition limitation by both fire and herbivory, (ii) that in some cases herbivory alone, notably by elephants and impala, can be more significant than fire alone, on woody plant population size, (iii) that fire and herbivory together are a lethal combination for woody plants and, (iv) that differences in strategies and responses of savanna plants to fire and herbivory are poorly explored.

TI Regreening of involucral leaves of female Leucadendron (Proteaceae)
   after flowering
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY

AB Involucral leaves of Leucadendron have the remarkable ability to turn yellow upon flowering and regreen naturally as the florets of the inflorescence wilt. This colour change results from degradation of chlorophyll and to a lesser degree carotenoids, resulting in the unmasking of yellow colour. Chlorophyll levels were restored upon regreening. Degreening coincided with the complete dismantling of the thylakoid system, while keeping the outer plastid envelope intact. Regreening resulted from the complete redifferentiation of these gerontoplast-like plastids into functional chloroplasts. The colour change was directly linked to the development of the inflorescence. Complete removal of the inflorescence before flowering prevented the colour change while removal at full bloom, when involucral leaves were yellow, resulted in significantly faster regreening. This designates the inflorescence or florets as the possible origin of the colour change trigger and suggests that the colour change is involved with attraction of pollinators. Degreening and regreening also took place in a growth chamber under continuous high light intensity. Therefore neither pollination nor the presence of roots is required for regreening. It appears that colour change in Leucadendron results from a well-regulated degradation and subsequent synthesis of photosynthetic pigments.

AB The formation, structure, and single-crystal to single-crystal transformations of the dinuclear metallocycle [Ag(2)L(2)](PF(6))(2)center dot 2CH(3)CN (L= 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-bis(2-methylimidazole-1-yl-methyl)benzene) are described. The acetonitrile guest molecules can be removed without loss of single crystallinity to afford a porous material. CO(2) sorption isotherms were recorded at various temperatures and the structures and sorption behaviour of the crystals are compared with those of a previously reported analogous system. Upon exposure to acetone vapour, the desolvated crystals undergo a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation to form the acetone solvate.

AB The reaction of the potentially tetradentate N(4)-donor ligand N,N'-bis[(2-aminophenyl)methylidene]ethane-1,2-diamine (H(2)ane) with various rhenium(V)precursors led to the formation of different rhenium(V)complexes. With trans-[ReOBr(3)(PPh(3))(2)], the unusual '3+3' complex cation [Re(tnn)(Htnn)](2+) (H(2)tnn = N-(2-aminophenylmethylidene)ethane-1,2- diamine)was isolated. With trans-[ReO(2)(py)(4)]Cl, the complex [ReO(dne)] was found (H(3)dne = N(1)-2-aminobenzyl-N(2)-2-aminobenzylideneethane-1,2-diamine), and the cationic complex [ReO(ane)](+) was formed from cis-[ReO(2)I(PPh(3))(2)]. These products were characterized by (1)H NMR and IR spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction.

AB Background and Aims:
   Carotenoids and chlorophylls perform a number of essential roles in plants making their accurate quantification important to a variety of studies. We aimed to develop an extraction protocol to accurately determine the photosynthetic pigments in grapevine leaf and berry tissue, specifically focusing on limiting the degradation of these pigments.
   Methods and Results:
   An extraction protocol for grapevine leaf and berry tissue was systematically optimised by identifying a number of critical parameters. Extracted pigments were analysed using Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). Specific parameters that were optimised included avoiding freeze-drying the material; the volume of acetone and the time required to extract all the pigments from the tissue; the addition of 0.1% (v/v) N-ethyldiisopropylamine to berry extracts to minimise pigment degradation during the extraction procedure; and avoiding concentration of the extracts that otherwise resulted in differential degradation of pigments. Additionally, the method of extraction and normalisation with an internal standard was adapted and improved for accuracy. The optimised protocol was validated using authentic standards and its utility shown by analysing the pigment content of berries and leaves at different growth stages.
   Conclusions:
   A method has been developed that is able to extract and accurately quantify, by means of HPLC profiling, the levels of photosynthetic pigments from grape berries and leaves. The method avoided any degradation of the pigments during the extraction and was applicable to both berries and leaves in different stages of growth and development, indicating its general usefulness to vegetative and reproductive organs, even if their metabolic states are very different.
   Significance of Study:
   The divergence of methods used for photosynthetic pigment analysis in plants, each with specific advantages and disadvantages were considered and used to optimise a number of parameters in a single method that proved to be applicable to plant organs in different developmental stages. The method is fast, applicable to vegetative and reproductive grapevine tissues, avoids degradation of pigments and ensures maximum accuracy when quantifying these important pigments.

AB In the present study we collected 177 serum samples from ostriches (Struthio camelus) infected experimentally with A/ostrich/South Africa/Middleton/2004 (H5N2) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We tested these samples using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, the agar gel immunodiffusion test and three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. We considered the HI test, with homologous antigen and including pre-treatment of sera with 10% chicken red blood cells, as the gold standard. Detectable specific antibodies appeared on day 7 post-infection and persisted until the termination of the experiment. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the tests under evaluation and Cohen's K value were calculated. The results reported herein could be of assistance to decision-makers in drafting guidelines for the definition of the health status of ostriches and for trade purposes.

AB Purpose - New business ideas, especially those which address markets that do not yet exist, face huge difficulties in securing vital resources Hence, governments support the creation of a protected environment business incubators, in which these early ventures can develop Business incubators perform two different processes servicing the companies they host and fulfilling their main stakeholders demands Hence this paper is critical of whether business incubators in Lithuania have been installed due to real economic demand to help all the promising startups to develop or if they serve primarily political goals Business incubators are exposed to pressure from shareholders, both public and private, and adopt certain strategies to deal with their expectations The paper aims to explore how the management of business incubators understand their own position, tasks and challenges and how they see their business incubators performing now and in the future
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper adds viewpoints from the sociology based institutional theory, adopting a more critical view on how institutions emerge, how they are influenced by their environment and how they shape the environment in which they operate In depth interviews were conducted with the management of the business incubators The paper Included all seven business incubators of Lithuania five business incubators in Vilnius and two business incubators in Kaunas
   Findings - The studied Lithuanian business incubators have a strong focus on property together with the offering of training and consulting, although at a very superficial level There are strong arguments in favor of a mimicking process and institutional behavior What made these property developments so attractive was the available public money, particularly from the European Union As long as the money keeps flowing, there is a strong incentive to grow The managers say that their public shareholders provide only weak support after the business incubator was set up Their private investors, on the other hand are interested in high rents In addition teams operating the business incubators are small, most consisting of not more than three people a much lower number than the European average of 12
   Originality/value - The empirical results offer interesting insights into the self understanding of the management of Lithuanian business incubators their setup and the environment in which they operate

AB Extrapair mating is known to occur in many animals and potentially has a significant influence on reproductive success. Female extrapair mate choice may explain the occurrence of exaggerated ornaments in socially monogamous species, but the influence of ornamentation on extrapair mating success has rarely been investigated experimentally. Cape sugarbirds (Promerops cafer) are socially monogamous, almost always lay 2 egg clutches and have long-term pair bonds often lasting several seasons. However, they also display sexually dimorphic extravagant ornamentation in the form of a long, graduated tail and have one of the highest rates (65% of young) of extrapair paternity recorded in birds. We provide a test of the hypothesis that the ornamented tail is used in mate choice for extrapair partners by conducting an experiment in which tail length was manipulated after social mating but before copulation. This experiment therefore allowed females to respond to the manipulation of male tail length when making a choice of copulation partner but not social mate. We show that the tail length of male sugarbirds has a significant effect on the success of males in gaining extrapair paternity, with long-tailed males obtaining significantly more extrapair young than short-tailed males. However, males with short tails sire a significantly greater proportion of the nestlings in their own nests than long-tailed individuals. This result suggests that males may adopt alternative strategies dependent on their ornamentation.

AB Group-living will evolve when individuals increase their lifetime reproductive success by joining with other individuals. In cooperatively breeding societies, individuals living in a group will participate in the communal rearing of young. Several factors can influence the evolutionary trade-offs of grouping and it is often unclear whether cooperative breeding is advantageous or is simply a by-product of selection acting on grouping behaviour. We used sightings of 1318 warthogs in 711 groups to investigate whether the advantages of sociality in the warthog differ depending on an individual's age, sex, reproductive state, or the time of year. Adult males only formed temporary associations with other individuals indicating that participation in a group was not advantageous. In contrast, yearlings were almost inevitably found in groups, regardless of their sex or time of year, suggesting any costs to sociality were outweighed by the benefits. Grouping in adult female warthogs was complex; adult females were more likely to form groups in the presence of juveniles and when juveniles were at their most vulnerable stage indicating that sociality in females could be partially explained by the benefits of communal care of young. However, other factors influenced female cooperation including group composition and the time of year.

AB Optimality theory suggests that territorial scent marks are under selective pressure through the information they provide about competitive quality/reproductive status and so should be situated to maximize their detection to alert conspecifics that they are intruding upon the territory of a resident. Factors that increase mark detectability are consequently beneficial to both resident and intruder by allowing tactical withdrawal by intruders and, thus, reducing the costs of conflict. We tested whether black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) preferentially deposited territory marks on substrates (rocks or faeces) in two separate sites in South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) dung piles were preferentially defecated upon by jackals in both sites. Where black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) was present at relatively high density, rhino middens were also preferentially marked by jackals; however, jackals resorted to defecating on elevated surfaces, such as rocks, where rhinos were scarce. We hypothesize that the odour of elephant and rhino dung may increase the detectability of jackal markings while providing an additional olfactory signal component, while rocks and elephant dung provide visual amplification. Manipulative experimentation will be necessary to confirm our multimodal amplification hypothesis.

ID WRITTEN ASSESSMENT
AB Student assessment is central to the educational process and can be used for multiple purposes including, to promote student learning, to grade student performance and to evaluate the educational quality of qualifications. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that assessment instruments are of a high quality. In this article, we present various tools that instructors could use, both to improve instrument design and validity before presentation to students and, to evaluate the reliability and quality of the assessment after students have answered the questions. In keeping with our goals of the Bridging-the-Gap series, we also present various ideas from the educational literature regarding the evaluation of assessment quality and end with a list of criteria that instructors could use to guide their evaluation process.

AB The non-insecticidal control strategies currently being implemented in South African orchards for the control of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) may be hampered bywooden fruit bins being infested with diapausing codling moth larvae, acting as a potential source of re-infestation. Key factors contributing to the success or failure of an entomopathogenic nematode application were investigated using the SF 41 isolate of Heterorhabditis zealandica in laboratory bioassays with wooden minibins. Under operational conditions, an application rate of 100 IJs/mL (LD(90) = 102 IJs/mL) effectively controlled codling moth larvae in these bins, and for further laboratory bioassays, the LD(50) value of 18 IJs/mL (approximate to 25 IJs/mL) was identified as the discriminating dosage. Maximum mortality was attained when bins were pre-wet for at least 1 min (> 90% RH) and maintained at maximum humidity (> 95% RH) post-treatment for at least 3 days (LT(90) = 73 h), to ensure nematode survival and subsequent satisfactory infection of diapausing codling moth larvae. Tarping bins achieved the desired high level of humidity required. Furthermore, adjuvants (specifically Reverseal 10 (TM)) also improved an application. The study conclusively illustrated that if all the above-mentioned conditions are met, H. zealandica has the potential to successfully disinfest wooden fruit bins of codling moth.

AB Embracing comparative biology, natural history encompasses those sciences that discover, decipher and classify unique (idiographic) details of landscapes, and extinct and extant biodiversity. Intrinsic to these multifarious roles in expanding and consolidating research and knowledge, natural history endows keystone support to the veracity of law-like (nomothetic) generalizations in science. What science knows about the natural world is governed by an inherent function of idiographic discovery; characteristic of natural history, this relationship is exemplified wherever an idiographic discovery overturns established wisdom. This nature of natural history explicates why inventories are of such epistemological importance. Unfortunately, a Denigration of Natural History weakens contemporary science from within. It expresses in the prevalent, pervasive failure to appreciate this pivotal role of idiographic research: a widespread disrespect for how natural history undergirds scientific knowledge. Symptoms of this Denigration of Natural History present in negative impacts on scientific research and knowledge. One symptom is the failure to appreciate and support the inventory and monitoring of biodiversity. Another resides in failures of scientiometrics to quantify how taxonomic publications sustain and improve knowledge. Their relevance in contemporary science characteristically persists and grows; so the temporal eminence of these idiographic publications extends over decades. This is because they propagate a succession of derived scientific statements, findings and/or conclusions - inherently shorter-lived, nomothetic publications. Widespread neglect of natural science collections is equally pernicious, allied with disregard for epistemological functions of specimens, whose preservation maintains the veracity of knowledge. Last, but not least, the decline in taxonomic expertise weakens research capacity; there are insufficient skills to study organismal diversity in all of its intricacies. Beyond weakening research capacities and outputs across comparative biology, this Denigration of Natural History impacts on the integrity of knowledge itself, undermining progress and pedagogy throughout science. Unprecedented advances in knowledge are set to follow on consummate inventories of biodiversity, including the protists. These opportunities challenge us to survey biodiversity representatively-detailing the natural history of species. Research strategies cannot continue to ignore arguments for such an unprecedented investment in idiographic natural history. Idiographic shortcuts to general (nomothetic) insights simply do not exist. The biodiversity sciences face a stark choice. No matter how charismatic its portrayed species, an incomplete 'Brochure of Life' cannot match the scientific integrity of the 'Encyclopedia of Life'.

AB Garlic has been used throughout the centuries to treat infections, heart disease, and cancer. Ajoene is one of the main compounds formed from heating crushed garlic as a mixture of E- and Z-isomers (E- and Z-4,5,9-trithiadodeca-1,6,11-triene 9-oxide). Ajoene possesses a broad spectrum of biological activities that include anticancer activity. It's cytotoxicity towards cancer cells is postulated to occur via an apoptotic mechanism involving activation of the mitochondrial-dependent caspase cascade. Structure-activity studies on ajoene and ajoene analogues have revealed that the Z-isomer is moderately more active than the E-isomer at inhibiting in vitro tumor cell growth, suggesting that specific protein interactions may be important. Substitution of the terminal end allyl. groups in ajoene for alkyl, aromatic, or heteroaromatic groups produces some analogs with superior in vitro anticancer activity to ajoene, opening up the way to developing ajoene-based anticancer agents.

AB Prevention of epibiosis is of vital importance for most aquatic organisms, which can have consequences for their ability to invade new areas. Surface microtopography of the shell periostracum has been shown to have antifouling properties for mytilid mussels, and the topography shows regional differences. This article examines whether an optimal shell design exists and evaluates the degree to which shell microstructure is matched with the properties of the local fouling community. Biomimics of four mytilid species from different regional provenances were exposed at eight different sites in both northern and southern hemispheres. Tendencies of the microtopography to both inhibit and facilitate fouling were detected after 3 and 6 weeks of immersion. However, on a global scale, all microtopographies failed to prevent fouling in a consistent manner when exposed to various fouling communities and when decoupled from other shell properties. It is therefore suggested that the recently discovered chemical anti-microfouling properties of the periostracum complement the anti-macrofouling defence offered by shell microtopography.

AB Hypoxia has become a world-wide phenomenon in the global coastal ocean and causes a deterioration of the structure and function of ecosystems. Based on the collective contributions of members of SCOR Working Group #128, the present study provides an overview of the major aspects of coastal hypoxia in different biogeochemical provinces, including estuaries, coastal waters, upwelling areas, fjords and semi-enclosed basins, with various external forcings, ecosystem responses, feedbacks and potential impact on the sustainability of the fishery and economics. The obvious external forcings include freshwater runoff and other factors contributing to stratification, organic matter and nutrient loadings, as well as exchange between coastal and open ocean water masses. Their different interactions set up mechanisms that drive the system towards hypoxia. Coastal systems also vary in their relative susceptibility to hypoxia depending on their physical and geographic settings. It is understood that coastal hypoxia has a profound impact on the sustainability of ecosystems, which can be seen, for example, by the change in the food-web structure and system function; other influences include compression and loss of habitat, as well as changes in organism life cycles and reproduction. In most cases, the ecosystem responds to the low dissolved oxygen in non-linear ways with pronounced feedbacks to other compartments of the Earth System, including those that affect human society. Our knowledge and previous experiences illustrate that there is a need to develop new observational tools and models to support integrated research of biogeochemical dynamics and ecosystem behavior that will improve confidence in remediation management strategies for coastal hypoxia.

AB We review here the available information on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from major marine, mostly coastal, oxygen (O-2)-deficient zones formed both naturally and as a result of human activities (mainly eutrophication). Concentrations of both gases in subsurface waters are affected by ambient O-2 levels to varying degrees. Organic matter supply to seafloor appears to be the primary factor controlling CH4 production in sediments and its supply to (and concentration in) overlying waters, with bottom-water O-2-deficiency exerting only a modulating effect. High (micromolar level) CH4 accumulation occurs in anoxic (sulphidic) waters of silled basins, such as the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin, and over the highly productive Namibian shelf. In other regions experiencing various degrees of O-2-deficiency (hypoxia to anoxia), CH4 concentrations vary from a few to hundreds of nanomolar levels. Since coastal O-2-deficient zones are generally very productive and are sometimes located close to river mouths and submarine hydrocarbon seeps, it is difficult to differentiate any O-2-deficiency-induced enhancement from in situ production of CH4 in the water column and its inputs through freshwater runoff or seepage from sediments. While the role of bottom-water O-2-deficiency in CH4 formation appears to be secondary, even when CH4 accumulates in O-2-deficient subsurface waters, methanotrophic activity severely restricts its diffusive efflux to the atmosphere. As a result, an intensification or expansion of coastal O-2-deficient zones will probably not drastically change the present status where emission from the ocean as a whole forms an insignificant term in the atmospheric CH4 budget. The situation is different for N2O, the production of which is greatly enhanced in low-O-2 waters, and although it is lost through denitrification in most suboxic and anoxic environments, the peripheries of such environments offer most suitable conditions for its production, with the exception of enclosed anoxic basins. Most O-2-deficient systems serve as strong net sources of N2O to the atmosphere. This is especially true for coastal upwelling regions with shallow O-2-deficient zones where a dramatic increase in N2O production often occurs in rapidly denitrifying waters. Nitrous oxide emissions from these zones are globally significant, and so their ongoing intensification and expansion is likely to lead to a significant increase in N2O emission from the ocean. However, a meaningful quantitative prediction of this increase is not possible at present because of continuing uncertainties concerning the formative pathways to N2O as well as insufficient data from key coastal regions.

AB Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species.

TI A landscape-scale assessment of the long-term integrated control of an
   invasive shrub in South Africa

AB The control of invasive alien plants often involves the integration two or more approaches, including mechanical clearing, the application of herbicides, burning, and biological control. More than one species of invasive plant can threaten the same area, which necessitates prioritization in the allocation of scarce resources to support the control of different species. This paper describes the integrated control of the invasive shrub Hakea sericea over four decades in South Africa. The species is widespread across an area of approximately 800 x 200 km, and occurs mainly in rugged, inaccessible and fire-prone mountain areas. The species is serotinous, and produces copious amounts of seed that are wind dispersed after fires. We present a brief history of the control measures which included a combination of felling and burning, augmented by biological control. We used data from two surveys, 22 years apart, to assess changes in distribution and density of the species. The assessment suggested that the overall distribution of the species was reduced by 64%, from similar to 530,000 to similar to 190,000 ha between 1979 and 2001. The species either decreased in density, or was eliminated from 492,113 ha, while it increased in density, or colonised 107,192 ha. We conclude that initial programs of mechanical clearing were responsible for reducing the density and extent of infestations, and biological control was largely responsible for the failure of the species to re-colonize cleared sites, or to spread to new areas following unplanned wildfires. We propose that a significant portion of the resources used for clearing Hakea in the past can be reallocated to mechanical control efforts against other invasive species (such as alien pines) for which effective biological control options are not available, provided that sufficient resources are allocated to ensure the widespread and effective implementation of all biological control agents to maintain the advances reported on here.

AB Salmonellosis and shigellosis are significant and persistent causes of diarrheal diseases among humans in developing countries. With that in mind, the current study investigates the occurrence of plasmid-encoded multidrug resistances in Salmonella and Shigella from diarrheal cases among humans. The isolates were characterized by serotyping, antimicrobial-susceptibility testing, transfer experiments and curing. The extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was detected by the double disc diffusion synergy test (DDST). A significant number of the plasmid-encoded multidrug resistant (PEMDR) Salmonella and Shigella isolates were found to harbour transferable plasmid genes resistant to antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and to a lesser extent to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The conjugative R-plasmids-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamase also showed resistances to cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefuroxime) and ampicillin. Curing experiments showed chromosomal resistances to varied antibiotics. The findings confirmed the presence of PEMDR in Salmonella and Shigella strains as a suitable adaptation to a changing antibiotic environment. The results therefore suggest the limited use of the commonly prescribed/or third generation cephalosporins as an empirical treatment of multidrug resistant Salmonella and Shigella because this may affect therapeutic outcomes.

AB The micromorphology of foliar trichomes of Hypoestes aristata var. aristata was studied using stereo, light and scanning microscopy (SEM). This genus belongs to the advanced angiosperm family Acanthaceae, for which few micromorphological leaf studies exist. Results revealed both glandular and non-glandular trichomes, the latter being more abundant on leaf veins, particularly on the abaxial surface of very young leaves. With leaf maturity, the density of non-glandular trichomes decreased. Glandular trichomes were rare and of two types: long-stalked capitate and globose-like peltate trichomes. Capitate trichomes were observed only on the abaxial leaf surface, while peltate trichomes were distributed on both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces.

AB Increasing pressure is being exerted on communities and nations to source energy from forms other than fossil fuels. Also, potable water is becoming a scarce resource in many parts of the world, and there remains a large divide in the demand and utilization of plant products derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and non-GMOs. The most extensive user and manager of terrestrial ecosystems is agriculture which is also the de facto steward of natural resources. As stated by Miller (2008) no other industry or institution comes close to the comparative advantage held for this vital responsibility while simultaneously providing food, fiber, and other biology-based products, including energy. Since modern commercial agriculture is transitioning from the production of bulk commodities to the provision of standardized products and specific-attribute raw materials for differentiated markets, we can argue that processes such as mass cultivation of microalgae and the concept of bio-refineries be seen as part of a 'new' agronomy. EBRU is currently exploring the integration of bioprocess technologies using microalgae as biocatalysts to achieve waste-water treatment, water polishing and endocrine disruptor (EDC) removal, sustainable energy production, and exploitation of the resultant biomass in agriculture as foliar fertilizer and seed coatings, and for commercial extraction of bulk commodities such as bio-oils and lecithin. This presentation will address efforts to establish a fully operational solar-driven microalgae bio-refinery for use not only in waste remediation but to transform waste and biomass to energy, fuels, and other useful materials (valorisation), with particular focus on environmental quality and sustainability goals.

AB The objective of our study was to test alternative polymer-on-polymer articulations for cervical total disc arthroplasty with favourable biotribological properties and the benefit of radiolucency in comparison to the clinically well established metal-on-polyethylene coupling. In vitro wear simulation was performed according to ISO 18192-1:2008 (E) with the clinically introduced active (R) cervical artificial disc (Aesculap AG Tuttlingen, Germany) made of UHMWPE/CoCr29Mo6 in a direct comparison to experimental disc articulations made of PEEK, CFR-PEEK and PEK. Each material combination was tested for 10 million cycles with a customised 6 station spinal wear simulator (EndoLab Thansau, Germany). Gravimetric and geometric wear assessment optical surface characterisation and an estimation of particle size and morphology were performed.
   The gravimetric wear rate of the clinical reference polyethylene-on-cobalt-chromium was 1.0 +/- 0.1 mg/million cycles, compared to 1.4 +/- 0.4 mg/million cycles for PEEK, to 0.02 +/- 0.02 mg/million cycles for CFR-PEEK and 0.8 +/- 0.1 mg/million cycles for PEK.
   In conclusion, a number of different candidate materials for total cervical disc arthroplasty were compared using the same disc design. Whereas the polymer-on-polymer articulation of PEK showed no substantial benefit in comparison to polyethylene-on-cobalt-chromium and whereas natural PEEK tends towards pitting and delamination, the carbon fibre reinforced PEEK demonstrated an excellent wear behaviour with a reduction in order of a magnitude. Therefore, the CFR-PEEK based polymer-on-polymer articulations may be an alternative to polyethylene-on-metal and have a high potential for next generation disc replacements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 37-amino acid polypeptide islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), or amylin, is found as amyloid aggregates in the islets of Langerhans in patients with type II diabetes. Herein, we report an efficient microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis of amylin (IAPP). The most efficient synthesis used double and triple couplings and 10 equiv. of amino acids. Double couplings were used for most amino acids, whereas triple couplings were utilized for amino acids in selected regions. The most effective method for formation of the disulfide bond in amylin was found to be iodine oxidation. The highest purity amylin was obtained when the crude peptide was purified with HPLC before formation of the disulfide bond. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized amylin product to RIN-5F cells was determined. The synthesized amylin exhibits an exponential increase of cytotoxicity at concentrations >35 mu M. Transmission electron microscope studies of a sample of amylin shows that insoluble amyloid fibrils spontaneously formed when 45 mu M solution of synthesized amylin was incubated in a suitable buffer for 6 h.
